Claude summary guidelines:
The goal is to create a LateX summary for the course Web-Development. main is the main LateX file containing the basic outline for the summary and where all components are comined into one file. layout_and_colours contains the style guidelines for the LateX code. There is a pre-existing summary, which is incomplete, but useful as a general guideline for my personal summary. especially the order of topics and structure of the document should be used for my own summary. There's also the slides/content from the lectures, which I added as context so that nothing of importance is accidentally forgotten. 

Content:
Content should be summarised such that only the important things are in there and one can easily navigate through the summary, but also include everything relevant from the course. For all types of code structures, which could be asked for during the exam, please create a "Kochrezept", aka a sort of recipe/algorithm/template on how to solve such a task. In the Style sheet this is referred to as "KR". Also create examples of exercises that might be part of an exam for each topic.

Newly created files:
keep image file names exactly the same. file name of the newly generated file should be exactly the same as the old one. If the code needs to be split up into multiple files name as follows: <section nr>_<subsection nr>_<subsection title>, e.g. 1_2_someTopic.tex

LateX conventions:
Use the layout_and_colours.sty style sheet as a reference. For each topic in the outline of the main file create a \section{], and within that file only create subsections, subsubsections and paragraphs to structure content. Try to avoid making too many titles though, such that there are no redundancies (aka not a \subsection{thisTopic} if there is only one \definition{thisTopic} and not more content. Use the tcolorboxes defined in the style sheet to create "blocks" of content in the summary. Lemma, Theorem, Corollary, Definition, Remark, Example and Examplecode are self explanatory from their names. Formula should be used for overviews and general information on how to put something together, Concept should be used instead of Definition for specific concepts that are exceptionally important. KR refers to "Kochrezept", as mentioned above. Code is used for snippets of code that aren't just examplary, but also define or explain a certain concept/command. Highlight, Mathhighlight and inlineequations should be used in mathematical summaries to emphasize important overviews, e.g. in an Analysis summary an overview of important integrals/differentials. 

To format any and all code snippets use lstlisting. These blocks should be within a tcolorbox. IMPORTANT note for LateX code: in lstlisting blocks ä/ö/ü are not recognized! please stick to ae/oe/ue respectively! (only simple UTF-8 encoding)
