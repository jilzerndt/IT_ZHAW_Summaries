# SUMMARY FROM LATEX: Exam-Focused Optimization

## OVERVIEW

Transform complete LaTeX files from extraction phase into concise, exam-ready summaries with:
- **Logical structure** (NOT lecture order)
- **Comprehensive KRs** for all problem types
- **2-3 examples per major topic**
- **Optimized layout** with multi-column grouping
- **30-50% length reduction** while maintaining exam completeness

**Quality target**: Match the level of `4th_Semester/CT2/LateX/content/lecture_summary/*.tex`

---

## TWO-PHASE WORKFLOW

### PHASE 1: STRUCTURE PLANNING (MANDATORY - USER APPROVAL REQUIRED)
Analyze extracted content and propose reorganization

### PHASE 2: SUMMARY CREATION (AFTER APPROVAL)
Create exam-focused summary following approved plan

⚠️ **You CANNOT skip Phase 1.** User must approve structure before you proceed to Phase 2.

---

# PHASE 1: STRUCTURE PLANNING

### 1. Content Inventory

List what you have:
- Major topics covered across all files
- Count definitions, theorems, concepts per topic
- Identify recurring problem types
- Note image priorities (CRITICAL/IMPORTANT/SUPPLEMENTARY)
- Identify KRs already present (if any)

**Template**:
```markdown

```

### 2. Exam Relevance Assessment

**Required information from user**:
- Which topics appear in old exams? (get list if available)
- Which problem types are tested most frequently?
- What are the learning objectives? (from syllabus)
- Which content is prerequisite vs. directly tested?

**If user provides old exams/exercises**, analyze:
- Count problem types: calculation, proof, implementation, analysis, design, etc.
- Identify topics that appear in >50% of exams (Priority 1)
- Identify topics that appear occasionally (Priority 2)
- Identify topics never tested (Priority 3 - candidates for removal)

**Template**:
```markdown
## EXAM RELEVANCE ANALYSIS

### Old Exam Topics (analyzed from 5 past exams):
- **Normalization** (5/5 exams, always tested) - PRIORITY 1
- **SQL Joins** (5/5 exams, 2-3 questions each) - PRIORITY 1
- **Transactions** (4/5 exams, 1-2 questions) - PRIORITY 1
- **Indexing** (2/5 exams, 1 question) - PRIORITY 2
- **Query Optimization** (1/5 exams, mentioned) - PRIORITY 2
- **Database History** (0/5 exams, never tested) - PRIORITY 3 (REMOVE)

### Problem Types Tested:
- Normalize table to 3NF (all 5 exams) - **NEED KR**
- Write complex SQL query (all 5 exams) - **NEED KR**
- Design E-R diagram (4/5 exams) - **NEED KR**
- Identify functional dependencies (4/5 exams) - **NEED KR**

3. Apply normalization → Priority 1 (tested heavily)
4. Design databases → Priority 1 (E-R diagrams tested)
5. Understand transactions → Priority 1 (tested frequently)
6. Optimize queries → Priority 2 (tested occasionally)
```

### 3. Structure Proposal

Propose logical organization (NOT lecture order):

**Principles**:
- Group related concepts together (even from different lectures)
- Order: prerequisites → core concepts → applications → advanced
- Most-tested topics prominently placed
- Create intuitive thematic sections

**Template**:
```markdown
## PROPOSED SUMMARY STRUCTURE

### Current Organization (from extraction):
- lecture01.tex: Introduction, History, Relational Model
- lecture02.tex: SQL Basics, SELECT queries
- lecture03.tex: SQL Joins, Subqueries
- lecture04.tex: Normalization Theory
- lecture05.tex: Transactions, ACID

### Proposed Summary Organization:

#### Chapter 1: Relational Model Foundations (20% of summary)
**Sources**: lecture01.tex (Relational Model section only)
**Topics**:
- Relations, tuples, attributes
- Keys (primary, foreign, candidate)
- Relational algebra basics

**Rationale**: Prerequisite knowledge for everything else. Tested indirectly.

**Content decisions**:
- KEEP: All key definitions (relation, tuple, key types) - 8 definitions
- KEEP: Relational algebra operators - 1 theorem
- KEEP: 2 examples (simple table, key identification)
- REMOVE: Database history (lecture01) - never tested
- REMOVE: Extended introduction (lecture01) - not exam-relevant
- ADD: KR for identifying keys
- Image decisions: Keep 2 CRITICAL (relation structure), Remove 1 SUPPLEMENTARY (timeline)

#### Chapter 2: SQL Fundamentals (25% of summary)
**Sources**: lecture02.tex + lecture03.tex (SQL sections)
**Topics**:
- SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY
- JOIN types (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
- Subqueries and aggregation
- GROUP BY, HAVING

**Rationale**: Heavily tested (5/5 exams). Group all SQL together for coherence.

**Content decisions**:
- KEEP: All JOIN definitions - merge similar ones into comparison table
- KEEP: 6 examples (2 easy JOIN, 2 medium JOIN, 1 hard nested query, 1 aggregation)
- MERGE: Definitions of INNER/LEFT/RIGHT JOIN → single comparative definition
- ADD: KR for writing complex queries (step-by-step approach)

**Sources**: lecture04.tex (entire file)
**Topics**:
- Functional dependencies
- Normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)
- Normalization process
- Denormalization tradeoffs

**Rationale**: Tested in ALL exams (5/5). Core skill students must master.

**Content decisions**:
- KEEP: All normal form definitions - consolidate into single progressive block
- KEEP: 3 examples (1 easy: obvious 3NF, 1 medium: multiple dependencies, 1 hard: BCNF edge case)
- MERGE: Definitions of 1NF/2NF/3NF → hierarchical structure showing progression
- ADD: KR for normalizing to 3NF (most frequently tested)
- ADD: KR for identifying functional dependencies

- REMOVE: Detailed implementation details - not tested at this level
- ADD: KR for explaining isolation levels
- ADD: Comparison table for ACID properties
- Image decisions: Keep 3 CRITICAL (transaction state diagram, isolation level table)

#### Chapter 5: Indexing & Performance (10% of summary - REDUCED)
**Sources**: lecture06.tex (selected sections)

### Summary Statistics:
- **Reorganization**: From 5 lecture-ordered files → 6 thematic chapters
- **Length reduction target**: From ~2800 lines → ~1100-1400 lines (40-50% reduction)
- **Major changes**:
  - Removed: Database history (lecture01, 200 lines) - never tested

  - Removed: Detailed algorithm implementations (lecture06, ~150 lines) - too deep
  - Merged: Similar definitions across lectures (SQL, normalization)
  - Reorganized: All SQL content grouped together (was in lecture02 + lecture03)

### KR Inventory Needed:

Based on old exam analysis, create KRs for:
1. **How to Identify Primary/Candidate Keys** (tested: 3/5 exams) - Priority 1

- Decorative graphics - all SUPPLEMENTARY removed

### Final Image Count: 15 images (all CRITICAL or IMPORTANT)
```

### User Approval Checkpoint

**STOP HERE and present your structure proposal to the user.**

Say:
```
I've analyzed the extracted LaTeX files and propose the following structure
for the exam-focused summary:

[Present structure proposal above]

Key changes:
- Reorganized from lecture order to thematic grouping
- Removed [X]% of content (history, verbose intros, rarely-tested topics)
- Plan to add [Y] KRs for all tested problem types

**Total length reduction: ~[Z]%** (from [A] lines to [B-C] lines)

**Please review and approve** (or suggest modifications) before I proceed to
Phase 2 (summary creation).

Would you like me to adjust any of these decisions?
```

**DO NOT PROCEED TO PHASE 2 UNTIL USER APPROVES.**

User might request:
- "Keep topic X that I marked for removal"
- "Add KR for problem type Y"
- "Merge chapters A and B"

# PHASE 2: SUMMARY CREATION

**(Only execute after Phase 1 approval)**

## Content Reduction Strategy

Follow approved structure plan. For each chapter:

### KEEP (Essential Core - ~30-40% of original)

**Definitions**:
- Core concepts from learning objectives
- Terms that appear in exam questions
- Distinctions between similar concepts

**Theorems/Rules**:
- Frequently referenced results
- Prerequisite knowledge for problem-solving
- Rules applied in exam problems

**Examples**:
- 2-3 per major topic (vary difficulty)
- Match exam problem formats
- Cover different aspects of concept

**Formulas**:
- Used in calculations
- Referenced in multiple places

### MERGE (Consolidate Similar - ~10% of original)

**Multiple definitions of related concepts** → Single comprehensive block
Example: Instead of separate definitions for INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN,
create one comparative definition with table.

**Scattered remarks about same topic** → Consolidated note
Example: Warnings about NULL handling from lectures 2, 3, 4 → one remark block

**Similar examples** → Keep most instructive, mention others briefly
Example: 5 examples of simple SELECT queries → keep 2, note "similar patterns"

### REMOVE (Not Exam-Critical - ~50-60% of original)

**Historical background/motivation** - Unless specifically tested
**Detailed derivations** - Keep result, omit proof unless proofs are tested
**Redundant examples** - More than 3 examples of same type
**Tangential remarks** - Not connected to learning objectives
**Verbose explanations** - Make concise
**Extended introductions** - Cut to essentials
**"Nice to know" content** - Keep only "need to know"

### ADD (Study Aids - new content)

**KR blocks** - For every problem type (see KR Framework below)
**Additional examples** - Where gaps exist after reduction
**Comparison tables** - For similar concepts (e.g., JOIN types, normal forms)
**Quick reference blocks** - Formula collections, command summaries

### Target

**30-50% of original extraction length**

Example: 2800 lines → 1100-1400 lines

---

## KR Creation Framework

**CRITICAL**: Every problem type students must solve needs a KR block.

### KR Structure Template

```latex
\begin{KR}{How to [Task Name]}\\
\textbf{Given:} [What information you start with]

\textbf{Goal:} [What you're solving for / proving / calculating]

\textbf{Procedure:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [Step 1 with specific action]: [formula or method] (reference Theorem X.Y if applicable)
    \item [Step 2 with decision point]: If [condition], then [action A]; else [action B]
    \item [Step 3 with calculation]: [Specific instruction with example]
    \item [Step 4 with verification]: Check that [condition holds / sanity check]
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Common mistakes:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [Mistake 1]: [Description] → [How to avoid]
    \item [Mistake 2]: [Description] → [How to avoid]
\end{itemize}

\textbf{When to use this approach:} [Recognition criteria - how to identify this problem type]
\end{KR}
```

### KR Coverage Requirements

- ✅ Every old exam problem type has corresponding KR
- ✅ Every exercise type has corresponding KR
- ✅ Every "how to" learning objective has corresponding KR
- ✅ Every procedural skill tested has corresponding KR

### KR Quality Standards

**Written for exam conditions**:
- Student solving problem under time pressure
- All steps included (even "obvious" ones)
- References to theorems/definitions/formulas by name
- Decision points clearly stated
- Common errors noted (from experience/solutions)

**Completeness test**: Could student follow KR to solve any problem of this type?

### KR Examples by Domain

**Mathematics**:
```latex
\begin{KR}{How to Prove by Induction}\\
\textbf{Given:} Statement $P(n)$ to prove for all $n \geq n_0$

\textbf{Goal:} Show $P(n)$ is true for all $n \geq n_0$

\textbf{Procedure:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Base case}: Prove $P(n_0)$ is true directly
    \item \textbf{Inductive hypothesis}: Assume $P(k)$ is true for arbitrary $k \geq n_0$
    \item \textbf{Inductive step}: Prove $P(k+1)$ is true using assumption $P(k)$
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Start with $P(k+1)$ (left side)
        \item Apply inductive hypothesis $P(k)$
        \item Manipulate to show $P(k+1)$ holds
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Conclusion}: By mathematical induction, $P(n)$ true for all $n \geq n_0$
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Common mistakes:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Forgetting base case → Always prove $P(n_0)$ first
    \item Assuming what you're trying to prove → Only assume $P(k)$, prove $P(k+1)$
    \item Incomplete inductive step → Must explicitly show how $P(k)$ implies $P(k+1)$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{When to use:} Statement involves "for all natural numbers $n$" or similar.
\end{KR}
```

**Databases**:
```latex
\begin{KR}{How to Normalize to 3NF}\\
\textbf{Given:} Relation $R$ with attributes and functional dependencies (FDs)

\textbf{Goal:} Decompose $R$ into relations in Third Normal Form (3NF)

\textbf{Procedure:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Ensure 1NF}: Check all attributes contain only atomic values
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If multi-valued attributes exist, create separate relation
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ensure 2NF}: Remove partial dependencies
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Identify composite keys
        \item Find non-key attributes dependent on only part of key
        \item Create separate relation for each partial dependency
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ensure 3NF}: Remove transitive dependencies
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Find non-key attributes that determine other non-key attributes
        \item For each transitive dependency $A \to B \to C$, create relation $(A, B)$ and $(B, C)$
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Verify}: Check all FDs preserved and decomposition is lossless
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Common mistakes:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Forgetting to verify lossless join property → Always check can reconstruct original relation
    \item Missing indirect transitive dependencies → Carefully trace all FD chains
    \item Incorrect identification of partial dependencies → Review definition: non-key depends on part of composite key
\end{itemize}

\textbf{When to use:} Asked to "normalize relation to 3NF" or "eliminate redundancy".
\end{KR}
```

**Programming**:
```latex
\begin{KR}{How to Implement Binary Search}\\
\textbf{Given:} Sorted array $arr$ and target value $target$

\textbf{Goal:} Return index of $target$ in $arr$, or -1 if not found

\textbf{Procedure:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Initialize}: Set $left = 0$, $right = arr.length - 1$
    \item \textbf{Loop while} $left \leq right$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Calculate $mid = \lfloor (left + right) / 2 \rfloor$
        \item If $arr[mid] == target$: return $mid$ (found)
        \item If $arr[mid] < target$: set $left = mid + 1$ (search right half)
        \item If $arr[mid] > target$: set $right = mid - 1$ (search left half)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{If loop exits}: return -1 (not found)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Common mistakes:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Integer overflow in $mid$ calculation → Use $mid = left + (right - left) / 2$
    \item Off-by-one errors → Ensure $left \leq right$ (not $<$) and $mid + 1 / mid - 1$ (not $mid$)
    \item Forgetting array must be sorted → Binary search only works on sorted arrays
\end{itemize}

\textbf{When to use:} Searching sorted array, complexity must be $O(\log n)$.
\end{KR}
```

---

## Example Creation

Add 2-3 examples per major topic after KRs.

### Example Structure Template

```latex
\begin{example2}{[Problem Type] - [Difficulty: Easy/Medium/Hard]}\\
\textbf{Task:} [Clear problem statement matching exam style]

\textbf{Given:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [All provided information]
    \item [Initial conditions]
    \item [Constraints]
\end{itemize}

[Any necessary context, data, or setup]

\tcblower

\textbf{Solution:}

\textit{Strategy:} [Brief explanation of approach - which KR to use]

\begin{enumerate}
    \item [Step 1 with reasoning and intermediate result]
    \item [Step 2 showing calculation/transformation]
    \item [Step 3 explaining key decisions made]
    \item [Step 4 reaching conclusion]
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Final answer:} [Clearly stated result with units/format]

\important{Key technique:} [Transferable skill or insight applicable to similar problems]
\end{example2}
```

### Example Selection Criteria

**Coverage**: Cover most common exam question formats
**Difficulty spread**: 1 easy (direct application), 1 medium (multi-step), 1 hard (tricky edge case) per major topic
**Exam alignment**: Match actual exam style (check old exams)
**Concept illustration**: Each example shows different aspect of topic

**Example distribution across chapter**:
```
Chapter 2 (SQL):
- 1 easy JOIN example
- 1 medium nested query example
- 1 hard aggregation with HAVING example

Chapter 3 (Normalization):
- 1 easy 3NF example (obvious transitive dependency)
- 1 medium example (multiple dependencies)
- 1 hard BCNF edge case example
```

---

## Structure Optimization

### Logical Organization (NOT Lecture Order)

Pattern:
```latex
\section{[Thematic Chapter Name]}

% Group related short definitions with \mult{2}
\mult{2}
\begin{definition}{Concept A}\\
[Concise definition]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Concept B}\\
[Concise definition]
\end{definition}
\multend

% Show relationship
\begin{theorem}{How A and B Relate}\\
[Key relationship, comparison, or rule]
\end{theorem}

% Procedure for application
\begin{KR}{When to Use A vs B}\\
[Decision criteria with step-by-step procedure]
\end{KR}

% Concrete application
\begin{example2}{Applying A and B - Medium}\\
[Problem demonstrating both concepts]
\tcblower
[Solution showing decision-making process]
\end{example2}
```

### Layout Principles

**Multi-column grouping** (`\mult{2}...\multend`):
- Use for short related blocks (definitions, concepts, theorems)
- Typical: 2-4 blocks per group
- Balances content across columns

**Single-column content**:
- Long KRs (>10 lines)
- Complex examples
- Detailed explanations
- Wide tables or code

**Column control**:
- `\raggedcolumns` before `\columnbreak` to balance columns
- Strategic `\pagebreak` between major sections
- Reference: See CT2 main file for pattern

### Section Hierarchy

**Appropriate nesting** (max 3 levels):
```
\section{Main Topic}          % Chapter level
  \subsection{Subtopic}        % Major concept
    \subsubsection{Detail}     % Specific aspect
```

**Use `\paragraph{}`** for minor points instead of excessive `\subsubsection{}`

**Merge subsections** if <3 content blocks in section

**Avoid**:
- Single subsection in section (just use paragraphs)
- Deeply nested structure (>3 levels)
- Redundant section titles

---

## Image Handling

### Review ALL TODO comments from extraction

**KEEP**:
- CRITICAL priority images (18 → keep all 18)
- IMPORTANT priority images if exam-relevant (12 → keep 10, remove 2 redundant)

**REMOVE**:
- SUPPLEMENTARY priority images (5 → remove all 5)
- Images from removed topics
- Redundant diagrams showing same concept

### Update image TODO comments

```latex
% TODO: Add image from Lecture_03.pdf, Slide 15
% Description: Normalization dependency diagram showing transitive dependency example
% Priority: CRITICAL (concept appears in 5/7 old exams, diagram essential for understanding)
% Suggested filename: 03_normalization_transitive_dependency.png
\\
% \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{03_normalization_transitive_dependency.png}
\\
% WHEN YOU ADD IMAGE: Uncomment line above
```

**Priority update reasons**:
- "appears in X/Y old exams"
- "essential for understanding" / "helpful but not essential"
- "frequently asked" / "rarely tested"

**KEEP ALL `\includegraphics` LINES COMMENTED OUT!**

### Updated image summary at file end

```latex
% ===== IMAGE SUMMARY (POST-SUMMARIZATION) =====
% Images retained: 28 (reduced from 35 in extraction)
% Breakdown: CRITICAL: 18, IMPORTANT: 10
% Images removed: 7 (5 SUPPLEMENTARY + 2 redundant IMPORTANT)
%
% Extraction checklist (priority order):
% [ ] [Source.pdf, Page X] - [description] (CRITICAL)
% [ ] [Source.pdf, Page Y] - [description] (CRITICAL)
% [ ] [Source.pdf, Page Z] - [description] (IMPORTANT)
% =====================
```

---

## Formatting Standards

Follow ALL rules from `misc_files/automatisation/reference_style_guide.txt`.

### Critical Rules

- `\\` after environment titles (EXCEPT before itemize/enumerate)
- Comment ALL `\includegraphics` with `%` prefix
- `[language=X, style=base]` for all lstlisting
- No ä/ö/ü in code blocks (use ae/oe/ue)
- Escape special characters: \$, \&, \%, \_, \{, \}
- Proper math notation: $inline$ and $$display$$

### Math-Heavy Courses

Apply `misc_files/automatisation/specialty_math.txt` enhancements:
- Number sets: \N, \Z, \Q, \R, \C
- Operators: \sin, \cos, \lim, \sum (upright, not italic)
- Highlight boxes for formula collections
- `align*` environment for step-by-step derivations
- `\begin{iequation}...\end{iequation}` for important equations

### Programming Courses

Apply `misc_files/automatisation/specialty_programming.txt` enhancements:
- Algorithm complexity in KRs and examples
- Design pattern structure blocks
- Data structure operation tables
- Complete code examples in `examplecode{}` environment

---

## Quality Reference: CT2 Example

Your output should match the quality of:
**`4th_Semester/CT2/LateX/content/lecture_summary/*.tex`**

### Key Patterns from CT2

**File organization**:
- Numbered files (01_, 02_, ...) for logical ordering
- Each file is one major topic/chapter
- ~200-400 lines per file (manageable size)

**Layout**:
- Heavy use of minipages for side-by-side content
- Strategic `\mult{2}` grouping for related short blocks
- Register details with bitfield explanations (for hardware topics)
- Comprehensive image integration (262 images total)

**Content mix**:
- Theory (definitions, concepts, theorems)
- Practice (code examples, procedures, KRs)
- Hardware-specific (register addresses, configurations)

**Environment usage**:
- Extensive use of custom environments (definition, concept, code, theorem, KR)
- Proper `\\` placement throughout
- Well-structured examples with `\tcblower`

**Multiple outputs**:
- Full lecture summary (comprehensive)
- Midterm summary (focused subset)
- Coding guidelines (standalone reference)

**Quality indicators**:
- Dense but readable
- Logical flow within each file
- Cross-references between sections
- Practical focus (not just theory)

## Output Deliverables

### 1. Summary File(s)

Same naming as input (if extracted as lectureXX.tex, now becomes XX_topic_name.tex):

**Example renaming**:
- lecture01.tex + lecture02.tex (SQL sections) → 02_sql_fundamentals.tex
- lecture04.tex (normalization) → 03_normalization.tex

**OR** keep lecture naming if one-to-one mapping.

### 2. Change Log

Provide detailed summary of changes:

```markdown
## SUMMARY CREATION REPORT

### Structure Transformation

**From** (extraction):
- 5 files following lecture order (lecture01.tex through lecture05.tex)
- Total: 2800 lines

**To** (summary):
- 6 files with thematic organization:
  01_relational_model.tex (280 lines)
  02_sql_fundamentals.tex (350 lines)
  03_normalization.tex (320 lines)
  04_transactions.tex (210 lines)
  05_indexing.tex (140 lines)
  06_database_design.tex (140 lines)
- Total: 1440 lines

**Length reduction**: 49% (2800 → 1440 lines)

### Major Changes

**Reorganization**:
- Grouped all SQL content together (was in lecture02 + lecture03)
- Moved E-R diagrams to separate design chapter (was scattered in lecture03)
- Reordered chapters by exam importance (normalization before transactions)

**Content Removed** (~1360 lines):
- Database history (lecture01, 200 lines) - never tested
- Extended introductions (all lectures, ~300 lines) - not exam-relevant
- Detailed implementation details (lecture06, ~250 lines) - too deep for exam
- Redundant examples (trimmed from 28 to 18) - kept most instructive only
- Verbose explanations (condensed throughout, ~400 lines saved)
- Performance tuning details (lecture06, ~210 lines) - not tested

**Content Merged**:
- JOIN type definitions (separate in lecture03) → single comparative table
- Normal form definitions (verbose in lecture04) → hierarchical progression
- ACID properties (scattered in lecture05) → consolidated overview

### Content Added

**KRs created**: 8 total
1. How to Identify Keys (added to Chapter 1)
2. How to Write Complex SQL Queries (added to Chapter 2)
3. How to Choose JOIN Type (added to Chapter 2)
4. How to Identify Functional Dependencies (added to Chapter 3)
5. How to Normalize to 3NF (added to Chapter 3)
6. How to Create E-R Diagram (added to Chapter 6)
7. How to Explain Isolation Levels (added to Chapter 4)
8. When to Create Index (added to Chapter 5)

**Examples added/refined**: 18 total (from 28 in extraction)
- Distribution: 6 easy, 8 medium, 4 hard
- Replaced generic examples with exam-style problems
- Added difficulty labels to all examples

**New content**:
- Comparison table: JOIN types (Chapter 2)
- Comparison table: Normal forms (Chapter 3)
- Comparison table: ACID properties (Chapter 4)
- Quick reference: SQL command syntax (Chapter 2)

### Image Changes

**Images retained**: 28 (from 35 in extraction)
- CRITICAL: 18 (all kept)
- IMPORTANT: 10 (from 12, removed 2 redundant)
- SUPPLEMENTARY: 0 (all 5 removed)

**Images removed**: 7 total
- Database timeline (lecture01) - topic removed
- 2 redundant JOIN diagrams (lecture03) - similar to others
- 3 implementation detail diagrams (lecture06) - topic reduced
- 1 decorative graphic (lecture01) - SUPPLEMENTARY priority

**Priority updates**:
- Updated 12 images with exam frequency information
- Example: "appears in 5/7 old exams" added to normalization diagrams

### Coverage Verification

**Learning objectives**: ✅ All 6 covered
**Old exam topics**: ✅ All Priority 1 topics covered (5/5 tested topics)
**Exercise problem types**: ✅ All 8 types have KRs

### Quality Metrics

**Content blocks per chapter** (average): ~12
**KRs per chapter**: 1-2 (total 8)
**Examples per major topic**: 2-3 (total 18)
**Images per chapter**: 3-6 (total 28)

**Estimated compiled length**: ~25-30 pages (2-column landscape, 8pt font)
**Estimated review time**: 4-6 hours for thorough study

### Key Decisions Rationale

**Why reorganized from lecture order?**
- Exam tests topics in different order than taught
- Grouping related concepts improves understanding
- Students need quick access to frequently-tested material

**Why removed database history?**
- Never appeared in any of 5 past exams
- Not in learning objectives
- 200 lines = 7% of extraction = significant space savings

**Why merged normal form definitions?**
- Originally spread across 3 pages with repetitive explanations
- Hierarchical presentation (1NF → 2NF → 3NF progression) clearer
- Reduced from 600 lines to 200 lines without losing information

**Why 8 KRs specifically?**
- Mapped exactly to 8 problem types tested in exams
- Every student skill that appears in old exams has a KR
- Ensures comprehensive exam preparation
```

### 3. User Feedback Questions

After delivery, ask user:

```
Summary complete! Please review:

1. **Structure**: Does the thematic organization make sense? Should any chapters be merged/split?

2. **KRs**: Are there any additional problem types you need KRs for?

3. **Examples**: Do you want more/fewer examples on any topic?

4. **Length**: Is 1440 lines (~25-30 pages compiled) manageable for review? Should I reduce further?

5. **Images**: Are the 28 retained images the right ones? Any critical ones I marked SUPPLEMENTARY?

6. **Missing content**: Did I remove anything you feel is exam-important?

Please let me know any adjustments needed!
```

## Final Reminders

### This Phase is About OPTIMIZATION FOR EXAM SUCCESS

**Not comprehensiveness**: Don't try to include everything
**Not perfection**: Aim for practical exam preparation
**Not preservation**: Be willing to cut non-essential content

### Quality Metrics

**Good summary**:
- Every tested skill has a KR
- Structure is logical and intuitive
- Examples match exam difficulty
- Length is manageable for review
- Dense but not overwhelming

**Great summary** (CT2 level):
- All above PLUS:
- Beautiful layout with strategic multi-column grouping
- Comprehensive image integration
- Multiple versions (full, midterm, reference)
- Cross-references between related topics

### Your Goal

Create a summary that enables student to:
1. **Learn** efficiently (logical organization)
2. **Practice** effectively (KRs for all skills)
3. **Review** quickly (concise, well-structured)
4. **Succeed** on exam (complete coverage)

**If student using ONLY your summary can ace the exam, you succeeded.**
