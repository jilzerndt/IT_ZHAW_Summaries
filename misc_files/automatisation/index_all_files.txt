## FILE USAGE GUIDE

### Quick Start Sequence:

```
1. Read: SETUP: Project Instructions
   → Set up Project and folder structure

2. Gather ALL materials: lectures, exercises, old exams, quizzes, etc.

3. Use: PROMPT: Phase 0
   → Create 00_intro.tex (cataloguing ALL materials)
   → Create 00_table_of_contents.tex

4. Phase 1A - Theory Extraction:
   For each lecture/script:
   Use: PROMPT: Phase 1A
   → Extract to lecture*.tex or script*.tex files
   → Split long lectures into parts (A, B, C)

5. Phase 1B - Exercise/Exam Extraction:
   For each exercise/exam:
   Use: PROMPT: Phase 1B
   → Extract to exercise*.tex, exam_*.tex, quiz*.tex
   → Identify problem types

6. Phase 1.5 - Structure Planning:
   After ALL extraction complete:
   Use: PROMPT: Phase 1.5
   → Analyze theory + exercises + old exams
   → Propose optimal structure
   → USER REVIEWS & APPROVES
   
7. Phase 2 - Summarization:
   For each chapter (following approved structure):
   Use: PROMPT: Phase 2
   → Create summary with KRs for all exam types
   → Use old exam problems as examples
   
8. Phase 3 - Validation:
   For each chapter:
   Use: PROMPT: Phase 3
   → Validate before moving to next

9. Extract images using TODO checklists

10. Compile final PDF
