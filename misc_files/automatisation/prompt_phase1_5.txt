# PROMPT: PHASE 1.5 - STRUCTURE PLANNING & ANALYSIS

Use this prompt AFTER Phase 1A (theory) and Phase 1B (exercises/exams) completion and BEFORE Phase 2 summarization to analyze ALL content and propose optimal summary structure.

---

## FULL PROMPT

```
Analyze the complete Phase 1A (theory) and Phase 1B (exercises/exams) content and create a comprehensive structure proposal for the exam summary.

INPUT FILES:
**Phase 1A - Theory Materials:**
- lecture01.tex, lecture02A.tex, lecture02B.tex, lecture03.tex, ...
- script_chapter01.tex, script_chapter02.tex, ...

**Phase 1B - Exercise Materials:**
- exercise01.tex, exercise02.tex, ...
- exam_FS2023.tex, exam_HS2022.tex, ...
- quiz01.tex, quiz02.tex, ...
- practice_*.tex

**Phase 0 - Reference Materials:**
- 00_intro.tex (learning objectives, course materials list)

COURSE CONTEXT:
- Course name: [Full name]
- Exam format: [Written/Oral/Practical, duration, question types]
- Exam weight distribution: [e.g., 40% theory, 60% practical]
- Learning objectives: [from 00_intro.tex]
- Known high-priority topics: [from syllabus/past exams]

---

ANALYSIS TASKS:

1. CONTENT INVENTORY

For each Phase 1A file (theory), identify:
- Main topics covered
- Key concepts and definitions
- Theorems/rules present
- Practical procedures that need KRs
- Examples that should be included/expanded
- Dependencies on other topics
- Exam relevance (high/medium/low based on course context)

For each Phase 1B file (exercises/exams), analyze:
- Problem types and frequencies
- Topics tested practically
- Skills required (what students must DO, not just know)
- Question patterns and formats
- Difficulty progression
- Topics appearing in OLD EXAMS (highest priority!)

Map the Phase 1B problems back to Phase 1A theory:
- Which theory topics support which problem types?
- Which KRs are needed for which problems?

2. PROBLEM TYPE ANALYSIS

From Phase 1B files, extract problem type frequencies:
- Count how many times each problem type appears
- Identify which topics have practical problems
- Note old exam problem types (most important!)
- Map problem types to required KRs

Example output:
```
Problem Type Frequency:
- Normalization to 3NF: 12 problems (8 in old exams) → HIGH PRIORITY KR
- SQL JOIN queries: 15 problems (10 in old exams) → HIGH PRIORITY KR
- ER diagram creation: 6 problems (2 in old exams) → MEDIUM PRIORITY KR
- Theory explanation: 8 problems (5 in old exams) → Needs clear definitions
```

3. LEARNING OBJECTIVE MAPPING

Cross-reference with learning objectives from 00_intro.tex:
- Which materials cover each objective?
- Are all objectives adequately covered?
- Which objectives appear most in exams?

4. OLD EXAM PATTERN ANALYSIS (CRITICAL!)

Analyze old exams specifically:
- What topics appear in EVERY old exam? → Must be in summary
- What question formats repeat? → Need matching KRs
- What's the typical difficulty progression?
- Are there "standard" questions that always appear?

5. RELATIONSHIP MAPPING

Identify:
- Sections/Topics that are conceptually related (even if from different lectures)
- Prerequisites and dependent concepts
- Topics that naturally group together thematically
- Redundancies or overlaps between theory and practice materials
- Gaps in coverage
- Is the original order of sections/topics optimal? Is there a better option?

IMPORTANT: The original learning order may NOT be the best for exam preparation! Do not hesitate to reorganize completely!!!!

---

STRUCTURE OPTIMIZATION:

CRITICAL: The summary does NOT need to follow lecture order. Reorganize content into the structure that makes most sense for learning and exam preparation.

LOGICAL GROUPING:
- Cluster related concepts together (even if from different lectures)
- Group by conceptual relationships, not chronological order
- Put prerequisites before dependent concepts
- Place most-tested topics prominently
- Create thematic sections that make intuitive sense

REORGANIZATION PRINCIPLES:
- If lectures covered Topic A in week 2 and Topic B in week 5, but they're closely related → group them together
- If a concept was introduced briefly early and expanded later → consolidate into one coherent section
- If topics naturally form a progression (basic → intermediate → advanced) → structure that way regardless of lecture order
- If exam focuses on certain combinations of topics → structure to facilitate that synthesis

EXAMPLE REORGANIZATION:
Lecture order: Introduction, History, Theory A, Applications, Theory B, More Applications
Better structure: Introduction, Theory A & B (grouped conceptually), All Applications (consolidated)

SECTION SIMPLIFICATION:
- Merge subsections that are very short (<3 blocks)
- Eliminate excessive nesting
- Use \paragraph{} instead of \subsubsection{} where appropriate
- Avoid redundancy (no subsection if only one definition block)

LAYOUT OPTIMIZATION:
\mult{2}
\begin{definition}{Concept A}\\
[Concise definition]
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}{Concept B}\\
[Concise definition]
\end{definition}
\multend

\begin{KR}{When to use A vs B}\\
[Decision criteria]
\end{KR}

\begin{example2}{Applying A and B}\\
[Problem demonstrating both]
\tcblower
[Solution showing decision-making]
\end{example2}

### COMPARISON: LECTURE ORDER vs. PROPOSED ORDER

#### Lecture Order (Phase 1):
1. Introduction & History
2. Basic Theory A
3. Applications of A
4. Basic Theory B
5. Applications of B
6. Advanced Theory A
