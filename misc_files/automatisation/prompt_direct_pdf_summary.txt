# DIRECT PDF → SUMMARY: Lecture-Based Exam Preparation

## OVERVIEW

Create exam-ready LaTeX summary **directly from PDF source materials** organized by lecture.

**One LaTeX file per lecture**: Summarize each lecture comprehensively, then extract related exercises exactly.

**Use when**:
- You have lecture materials (slides, notes) and exercises/old exams
- You want organized lecture-by-lecture structure
- You want exercises extracted word-for-word (no summarization)
- Willing to invest planning effort upfront for structured output

**Output**: Comprehensive lecture summaries + exact exercise extractions with KRs for all tested skills.

**Quality target**: Match `4th_Semester/CT2/LateX/content/lecture_summary/*.tex` level.

---

## WORKFLOW

### PHASE 1: PLANNING (Before Any Extraction) - USER APPROVAL REQUIRED
Scan all lectures and exercises, map exercises to lectures, propose structure

### PHASE 2: LECTURE-BY-LECTURE CREATION (After Approval)
For each lecture: Summarize content + extract related exercises EXACTLY + create KRs

⚠️ **You CANNOT skip Phase 1.** User must approve plan before extraction begins.

---

# REQUIRED INPUTS FROM USER

Before starting, user MUST provide:

## 1. Source Materials

**Lecture/Theory Materials**:
- Lecture slides PDFs
- Lecture scripts/notes PDFs
- Textbook chapters (if applicable)

**Practice Materials**:
- Exercise sheets and solutions PDFs
- Quiz/Moodle test materials
- Old exams PDFs (CRITICAL for identifying patterns)
- Practice problems

**Indicate for each**: File name, page count, what it covers

## 2. Exam Context

**Exam format**: [e.g., "Written exam, 2 hours, closed book"]
**Allowed materials**: [e.g., "One A4 handwritten sheet" / "All materials" / "Calculator only"]
**Question distribution**: [e.g., "40% theory definitions, 60% calculation problems"]
**Total points**: [e.g., "100 points total, 4-5 main questions"]

## 3. Learning Objectives

From syllabus or course description:
```
1. Understand [concept/theory]
2. Apply [method/technique]
3. Analyze [problem type]
4. Design [artifact type]
5. Evaluate [criteria/tradeoffs]
...
```

## 4. Old Exam Analysis (CRITICAL - If Available)

For each old exam available:
- Which topics appear? (list by exam)
- Which problem types are tested? (calculation, proof, implementation, explanation, etc.)
- Which lectures do problems relate to? (map problems to lectures)
- Any recurring patterns? (same problem type every year, specific difficulty level, etc.)

**If user provides 3+ old exams**: This dramatically improves summary quality.

**If NO old exams available**: Rely more heavily on learning objectives and exercise patterns.

## 5. Optional Context

**Grading breakdown**: [e.g., "Midterm 30%, Final 50%, Homework 20%"]
**Course emphasis**: [e.g., "Theory-heavy" / "Applied focus" / "Mixed"]
**Instructor style**: [e.g., "Focuses on proofs" / "Emphasizes practical applications"]

# PHASE 1: PLANNING

## Step 1: Scan Lecture Materials

**Scan each lecture** and note topics covered:

### Output Template:
```markdown
## LECTURE MATERIAL SCAN

**Lecture 1** ([Source Name], pages X-Y, Z slides):
- Main topics: [Topic A], [Topic B], [Topic C]
- Key concepts: [List important concepts introduced]
- Key diagrams/figures: Page X ([description]), Page Y ([description])
- Depth: [Brief/Moderate/Deep coverage]
- Estimated summary length: [X] lines

**Lecture 2** ([Source Name], pages Z-W, M slides):
- Main topics: [Topic D], [Topic E]
- Key concepts: [List important concepts]
- Key diagrams/figures: Page Z ([description])
- Depth: [Brief/Moderate/Deep coverage]
- Estimated summary length: [Y] lines

**Lecture 3** ([Source Name], pages A-B, N slides):
...

[Repeat for all lectures]

**Total lectures**: [X]
**Estimated total summary content**: [Y] lines
```

## Step 2: Scan Exercise and Exam Materials

**Scan all exercises and old exams** to understand problem types:

### Output Template:
```markdown
## EXERCISE & EXAM MATERIAL SCAN

### Exercises ([Source Name], X problems):
- **Problem Type A**: [X] problems (e.g., calculate [concept], prove [theorem], implement [algorithm])
- **Problem Type B**: [Y] problems (e.g., analyze [scenario], design [system])
- **Problem Type C**: [Z] problems
- Difficulty distribution: [X] easy, [Y] medium, [Z] hard
- Solutions: [Included/Not included]

### Old Exams ([Source Name], X exams):
- **Exam [Year 1]**: [Topic A] ([X]%), [Topic B] ([Y]%), [Topic C] ([Z]%)
- **Exam [Year 2]**: [Topic A] ([X]%), [Topic D] ([Y]%), [Topic B] ([Z]%)
...

### Problem Type Frequency Across Exams:
- **[Problem Type A]**: [X]/[Y] exams (e.g., "appears in 4/5 exams")
- **[Problem Type B]**: [X]/[Y] exams
- **[Problem Type C]**: [X]/[Y] exams
...

### Key Patterns:
- [Pattern 1]: [e.g., "Always includes 2-3 calculation problems"]
- [Pattern 2]: [e.g., "Theory questions focus on [Topics X, Y]"]
- [Pattern 3]: [e.g., "Proofs rarely tested (<20% of exams)"]
```

## Step 3: Map Exercises to Lectures

**Critical step**: Determine which exercises relate to which lectures.

### Mapping Strategy:
1. For each exercise, identify which lecture topics it tests
2. Assign exercise to the primary lecture it relates to
3. If exercise spans multiple lectures, user decides assignment or note cross-reference

### Output Template:
```markdown
## EXERCISE-TO-LECTURE MAPPING

**Lecture 1 → Exercises**:
- [Exercise 1.1] ([Source], Problem X) - tests [Topic A from Lecture 1]
- [Exercise 1.2] ([Source], Problem Y) - tests [Topic B from Lecture 1]
- [Old Exam Year Z, Problem A] - tests [Topic A]

**Lecture 2 → Exercises**:
- [Exercise 2.1] ([Source], Problem M) - tests [Topic C from Lecture 2]
- [Exercise 2.2] ([Source], Problem N) - tests [Topic D from Lecture 2]
- [Exercise 2.3] ([Source], Problem P) - tests [Topics C + D combined]
- [Old Exam Year W, Problem B] - tests [Topic C]

**Lecture 3 → Exercises**:
...

### Exercises Spanning Multiple Lectures:
- [Exercise X.Y] - covers [Topic A from Lecture 1] and [Topic D from Lecture 2]
  - Decision: Assign to [Lecture 1/2] as primary, note cross-reference in other

### Old Exam Problems (if comprehensive):
- If old exam tests material from many lectures:
  - Option A: Create separate `old_exams.tex` file
  - Option B: Distribute problems to lectures they primarily test
  - **User decides in approval step**

### Problem Types Identified:
Based on exercise mapping, list distinct problem types:
- **[Problem Type A]**: Tested by [X] exercises across [Y] lectures
- **[Problem Type B]**: Tested by [M] exercises across [N] lectures
- **[Problem Type C]**: Tested by [P] exercises across [Q] lectures
...

**Note**: Each distinct problem type will need a KR (mandatory).
```

## Step 4: Propose Lecture-Based Structure

**One LaTeX file per lecture** with integrated exercises.

### Output Template:
```markdown

# PHASE 2: LECTURE-BY-LECTURE CREATION

**(Only execute after Phase 1 approval)**

## Workflow: For Each Lecture

Process each lecture file in order (lecture01.tex, lecture02.tex, ...):

### Part A: Summarize Lecture Content

**Extract and reorganize** lecture material:

**Extract**:
- All key definitions (exact wording, but can condense if verbose)
- All important theorems, concepts, rules
- Key diagrams/figures (TODO comments for images)
- Important examples (where they enhance understanding)

**Reorganize for clarity**:
- Group related concepts together (don't just follow slide order)
- Create logical flow (simpler concepts → more complex)
- Use comparison tables where helpful
- Cross-reference related topics

**Add KRs for lecture concepts** (where helpful):
- If concept requires understanding a process, create KR
- If concept is frequently tested, create KR
- Use judgment - not every concept needs a KR

**Add helpful examples**:
- Add 1-2 examples where they clarify complex concepts
- Model after exam-style problems when possible
- Keep concise but complete

### Part B: Extract Related Exercises EXACTLY

⚠️ **CRITICAL: NO SUMMARIZATION OF EXERCISES** ⚠️

**For each exercise mapped to this lecture**:

1. **Extract complete problem text** - word-for-word:
   - All setup and context
   - All sub-questions (a, b, c, etc.)
   - All given information
   - All constraints and requirements
   - References to diagrams if any

2. **Extract complete solution** - word-for-word:
   - Full solution steps (don't shorten)
   - All intermediate calculations/derivations
   - All explanations
   - Final answer

3. **Format in example2 environment**:
```latex
\begin{example2}{[Exercise Type] - [Source Name] Exercise X.Y}\\
\textbf{Problem:} [Complete problem text extracted exactly]

[If multiple parts:]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [Part a complete text]
    \item [Part b complete text]
    ...
\end{enumerate}

\tcblower

\textbf{Solution:} [Complete solution extracted exactly]

[Solution details - not shortened...]

\important{Key technique:} [Highlight the primary skill being tested]
\end{example2}
```

### Part C: Create KRs for Exercise Types

⚠️ **MANDATORY: KR for EVERY distinct exercise type** ⚠️

After extracting all exercises for this lecture:

1. **Identify distinct problem types**: Group exercises by the skill they test
2. **Create one KR per problem type**: Even if only one exercise tests it

**KR Structure** (see `kr_examples_library.txt` for examples):
```latex
\begin{KR}{How to [solve this problem type]}\\
\textbf{Given:} [What information is provided]

\textbf{Goal:} [What you need to find/prove/create]

\textbf{Procedure:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [Step 1]
    \item [Step 2]
    ...
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Common mistakes:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [Mistake 1] → [How to avoid]
    \item [Mistake 2] → [How to avoid]
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Recognition:} Asked to "[typical wording in problems]"
\end{KR}
```

## Content Creation As You Extract

Simultaneously create optimized structure:

### 1. Environment Structuring

**Group related short blocks** with `\mult{2}`:
```latex
\mult{2}
\begin{definition}{Concept A}\\
[Concise definition]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Concept B}\\
[Concise definition]
\end{definition}
\multend

\begin{theorem}{Relationship A-B}\\
[How they relate or compare]
\end{theorem}
```

**Create comparison tables** where helpful:
```latex
\begin{highlight}{[Concept] Comparison}\\
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{3cm}|p{3cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Type/Method} & \textbf{Key Feature} & \textbf{Use When} \\
\hline
[Option A] & [Feature A] & [Context A] \\
[Option B] & [Feature B] & [Context B] \\
[Option C] & [Feature C] & [Context C] \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{highlight}
```

### 2. LaTeX Formatting Guidelines

Follow `misc_files/automatisation/reference_style_guide.txt`:
- `\\` after titles (except before lists)
- Comment ALL `\includegraphics`
- `[language=X, style=base]` for lstlisting
- Proper math notation
- Multi-column grouping for short blocks

### 4. Image TODO Comments

**Include essential and helpful images only**:

```latex
% TODO: add image from lectures_05-07.pdf, page 15
```

**Skip**:
- Decorative images
- Images from low-priority topics
- Redundant diagrams

## As You Build Each Lecture File

**For lecture content**:
- **Consolidate** similar definitions if lecture is redundant
- **Create** summary/comparison tables where helpful
- **Reorganize** by concept, not just slide order
- **Cross-reference** - note connections to other lectures

**For exercises**:
- **Extract EXACTLY** - resist urge to summarize
- **Keep complete** - all setup, all steps, all explanations
- **Create KR for every type** - even if only one exercise

---

## Formatting Standards

Follow `misc_files/automatisation/reference_style_guide.txt`:

- `\\` after titles (except before lists)
- Comment ALL `\includegraphics`
- `[language=X, style=base]` for lstlisting
- No ä/ö/ü in code
- Proper math notation
- Multi-column grouping for short blocks

**Quality target**: CT2 summary level (`4th_Semester/CT2/LateX/`)

- Formula collections in highlight blocks
- Step-by-step derivations with `align*`
- Proof technique KRs (if proofs tested)
- Number set commands (\N, \Z, \Q, \R, \C)

### Programming Courses

Apply `misc_files/automatisation/specialty_programming.txt`:
- Algorithm KRs with complexity
- Design pattern structure blocks
- Data structure operation tables
- Complete code examples in `examplecode{}`

### Mixed Theory/Practice Courses

Balance:
- Theory chapters: definitions + theorems + conceptual examples
- Practice chapters: procedures + code + KRs
- Integration chapters: examples using both

---

## Final Notes

### Lecture-Based Workflow

**Comprehensive approach**: One file per lecture with integrated exercises
**Balanced**: Lecture summaries (reorganized) + exact exercise extraction
**Structured**: Planning phase ensures nothing is missed

**Requires**:
- Thorough lecture-by-lecture scanning
- Careful exercise-to-lecture mapping
- Complete exercise extraction (no summarization)
- User involvement in planning phase

### Success Factors

**Good lecture summaries** = comprehensive yet clear (reorganized for understanding)
**Good exercise extraction** = EXACT extraction with complete solutions
**Good KRs** = coverage of all lecture concepts (where helpful) + EVERY exercise type (mandatory)
**Good structure** = logical organization within lectures, exercises integrated

### Quality Check

**Ask yourself**:
- Could student pass exam using ONLY this summary?
- Are all lectures summarized comprehensively?
- Were ALL exercises extracted EXACTLY (no shortening)?
- Does EVERY exercise type have its own KR?
- Is structure intuitive for learning?

**If all "yes"**, you succeeded.
