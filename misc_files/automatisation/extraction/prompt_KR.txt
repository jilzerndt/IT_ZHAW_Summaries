## NEXT STEP: STRUCTURE AND ADD KOCHREZEPTE!! (KR = Kochrezept)

For each chapter of the course, there is a LateX file with all exercises and their solutions, as well as a PDF containing the corresponding theory from the course. 

1. **KR Identification:** Problem types directly map to needed KRs -> identify subsections for each chapter based on problem types
   - Implementation problems → Need "How to implement X" KR
   - Calculation problems → Need "How to calculate Y" KR
   - etc.
   - create a subsection for each KR (exercise type), including all the examples (aka the exercises from the original source) that correspond to that KR below it. -> the subsection starts with the most important theory bits for that KR, then the KR itself, then all the examples that correspond to that KR.

2. **Theory + KR Integration:**
   - Open and read the corresponding PDF for the chapter. Make sure to fully read it before proceeding with the KRs.
   - Identify the MOST IMPORTANT bits of theory from the PDF for this chapter (and of course each KR/subsection) and include it in the LateX file, but FOCUS on adding the KOCHREZEPTE (KRs) for each exercise type -> really only the most important theory.

2. **Adding KRs to Exercise Blocks:**
   - For each problem type identified (aka subsectrion), create a corresponding KR block in the LateX file. 
   - Make sure to clearly define the steps or guidelines in the KR!! and follow the theory from the PDF if available for that KR.
