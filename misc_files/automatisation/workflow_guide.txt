# WORKFLOW GUIDE: Which Prompt When?

## Overview

You have **three distinct workflows** for creating LaTeX summaries:

1. **Prompt 1**: EXACT EXTRACTION (PDF → Complete LaTeX verbatim)
2. **Prompt 2**: SUMMARY FROM LATEX (LaTeX → Exam-focused summary)
3. **Prompt 3**: DIRECT PDF → SUMMARY (PDF → Exam summary one-shot)

This guide helps you choose the right workflow for your situation.

---

## Quick Decision Tree

```
START: I have PDF source materials and want a LaTeX summary

Q1: Do I want MAXIMUM FIDELITY (every word preserved)?
    YES → Use Prompt 1 (Exact Extraction)
    NO → Continue to Q2

Q2: Do I already have LaTeX files from previous extraction?
    YES → Use Prompt 2 (Summary from LaTeX)
    NO → Continue to Q3

Q3: Do I have OLD EXAMS showing exactly what's tested?
    YES + well-structured sources → Use Prompt 3 (Direct Summary)
    NO or unclear exam focus → Use Prompt 1 then Prompt 2

Q4: Am I willing to do Phase 1.5-style planning myself?
    YES → Use Prompt 3 (Direct Summary)
    NO → Use Prompt 1 then Prompt 2 (planning built into Prompt 2)
```

## Prompt 1: EXACT EXTRACTION

### When to Use

✅ **Perfect for**:
- First time processing a course
- Want complete LaTeX version for future reference
- Uncertain what will be exam-relevant yet
- Need high fidelity for later processing
- Want to preserve ALL content from source
- Have time for two-phase workflow (extract then summarize)

### Workflow

```
PDFs → [Prompt 1: Exact Extraction] → Complete LaTeX files
        ↓
        (Later, when ready to study)
        ↓
     [Prompt 2: Summary from LaTeX] → Exam summary
```

### Effort Investment

- **Time**: ~2-3 hours per course for extraction
- **Planning**: Minimal (just follow source structure)
- **Review**: Check completeness, formatting correctness
- **Output**: Complete LaTeX (~3000-5000 lines for typical course)

### Advantages

✅ Perfect fidelity - nothing skipped
✅ Complete reference for future use
✅ Can create multiple summaries later (midterm, final, etc.)
✅ Low risk of missing content
✅ Clear verification with chunking system

### Disadvantages

❌ Two-phase process (not immediate exam summary)
❌ Longer total time
❌ Creates large files that need reduction later
❌ Minimal prioritization at extraction stage

### Use Prompt 1 When:

- **Scenario 1**: "I just got all the course materials and want to convert everything to LaTeX for future use"
- **Scenario 2**: "I'm not sure yet what will be on the exam, so I want everything preserved"
- **Scenario 3**: "I want a complete digital reference of the course material"
- **Scenario 4**: "I have plenty of time before the exam (>2 weeks)"

---

## Prompt 2: SUMMARY FROM LATEX

### When to Use

✅ **Perfect for**:
- Already have LaTeX files (from Prompt 1 or previous work)
- Ready to create exam-focused version
- Have old exams or clear understanding of what's tested
- Want structured planning phase with user approval
- Need to reduce verbose extraction to manageable summary

### Workflow

```
Complete LaTeX files → [Prompt 2: Summary from LaTeX] → Exam summary
                       ↓
                    Phase 1: Planning (user approval)
                       ↓
                    Phase 2: Summary creation
```

### Effort Investment

- **Time**: ~3-4 hours per course (with planning)
- **Planning**: High (Phase 1 analysis + approval required)
- **Review**: Check structure, KR coverage, examples
- **Output**: Exam summary (~1000-1500 lines, 30-50% of original)

### Advantages

✅ Structured planning phase ensures quality
✅ User approval before execution (you control structure)
✅ Starting from complete LaTeX (no content skipped)
✅ Optimizes for exam success systematically
✅ Creates KRs for all tested skills
✅ Clear before/after comparison

### Disadvantages

❌ Requires existing LaTeX files
❌ Two-phase with mandatory approval step
❌ Planning phase takes time
❌ Higher effort than direct approach

### Use Prompt 2 When:

- **Scenario 1**: "I used Prompt 1 last month, now I have old exams and want to create exam summary"
- **Scenario 2**: "I have LaTeX files from last year's student, want to optimize for this year's exam"
- **Scenario 3**: "I want careful planning and approval before AI makes content decisions"
- **Scenario 4**: "I have messy/verbose LaTeX that needs expert optimization"
- **Scenario 5**: "I'm 1-2 weeks before exam and need focused study materials"

## Prompt 3: DIRECT PDF → SUMMARY

### When to Use

✅ **Perfect for**:
- Efficient one-shot workflow
- Well-structured source materials
- Have old exams (3+) showing clear patterns
- Clear understanding of exam focus
- Limited time (want exam summary quickly)
- Willing to invest in thorough planning upfront
- Confident in prioritization decisions

### Workflow

```
PDFs + Old Exams → [Prompt 3: Direct Summary] → Exam summary
                   ↓
                Phase 1: Prioritization planning (user approval)
                   ↓
                Phase 2: Focused extraction + summarization
```

### Effort Investment

- **Time**: ~4-5 hours per course (single pass)
- **Planning**: Very high (comprehensive upfront planning)
- **Review**: Check nothing exam-critical was skipped
- **Output**: Exam summary (~1000-1500 lines) directly

### Advantages

✅ Most efficient workflow (one pass)
✅ Fastest path to exam-ready summary
✅ Built-in prioritization (skip irrelevant content)
✅ Integrated planning + execution
✅ No intermediate files to manage
✅ Optimized for exam from the start

### Disadvantages

❌ Higher risk (if prioritization wrong, content missing)
❌ No complete LaTeX reference created
❌ Requires good old exam analysis
❌ Can't easily go back for skipped content
❌ Requires confident prioritization judgment

### Use Prompt 3 When:

- **Scenario 1**: "I have 5 old exams showing clear patterns, want fastest path to exam summary"
- **Scenario 2**: "Source materials are well-structured, I know exactly what's tested"
- **Scenario 3**: "Time-constrained (<1 week until exam), need exam summary NOW"
- **Scenario 4**: "I'm confident in identifying exam-relevant content"
- **Scenario 5**: "Don't need complete LaTeX reference, just exam prep materials"

## Workflow Combinations

### Combination 1: Complete Course Coverage

**Goal**: Complete reference + multiple summary versions

```
PDFs → [Prompt 1: Exact Extraction] → Complete LaTeX
        ↓                                    ↓
        Save for reference                   ↓
                                             ↓
        [Prompt 2: Summary from LaTeX] → Midterm Summary (focused)
                                             ↓
        [Prompt 2: Summary from LaTeX] → Final Exam Summary (comprehensive)
                                             ↓
        [Prompt 2: Summary from LaTeX] → Quick Reference (formulas/KRs only)
```

**When**: Plenty of time, want comprehensive materials
**Effort**: High (~8-10 hours) but creates multiple outputs

### Combination 2: Fast Track for Experienced User

**Goal**: Exam summary quickly

```
PDFs + Old Exams → [Prompt 3: Direct Summary] → Exam Summary
```

**When**: Time-constrained, clear exam patterns
**Effort**: Moderate (~4-5 hours) single output

### Combination 3: Safe Approach for Uncertain Exam

**Goal**: Preserve everything, optimize later when clear

```
PDFs → [Prompt 1: Exact Extraction] → Complete LaTeX
        ↓                                    ↓
        Save for reference                   ↓
        (Wait for more information)          ↓
        (Get old exams, learning objectives) ↓
                                             ↓
        [Prompt 2: Summary from LaTeX] → Exam Summary (when ready)
```

**When**: Early in semester, exam format uncertain
**Effort**: Spread over time (~2 hours now, 3-4 hours later)

### Combination 4: Hybrid Verification

**Goal**: Balance efficiency with verification

```
PDFs → [Prompt 3: Direct Summary] → Exam Summary (primary)
        ↓
        [Prompt 1: Exact Extraction] → Complete LaTeX (verification - extract critical chapters only)
        ↓
        Compare: Did Prompt 3 miss anything critical?
        ↓
        [Update summary if needed]
```

**When**: Want efficiency but some uncertainty
**Effort**: High (~6-7 hours) but thorough

## Decision Factors

### Factor 1: Time Until Exam

**>3 weeks**: Prompt 1 → Prompt 2 (safe, comprehensive)
**2-3 weeks**: Prompt 2 (if have LaTeX) or Prompt 3 (if confident)
**1-2 weeks**: Prompt 3 (fast track)
**<1 week**: Prompt 3 (prioritize only what's tested)

### Factor 2: Old Exam Availability

**5+ old exams**: Prompt 3 (clear patterns)
**2-4 old exams**: Prompt 2 or 3 (decent understanding)
**0-1 old exams**: Prompt 1 → Prompt 2 (preserve everything first)

### Factor 3: Source Material Quality

**Well-structured** (slides, clear sections): Prompt 3
**Mixed quality** (slides + scripts): Prompt 1 → Prompt 2
**Messy/redundant**: Prompt 1 (extract all) → Prompt 2 (clean up)

### Factor 4: Your Confidence Level

**High** (know exam inside out): Prompt 3
**Medium** (general idea): Prompt 2
**Low** (unsure what's tested): Prompt 1 → Prompt 2 when clear

### Factor 5: Desired Outputs

**Exam summary only**: Prompt 3
**Exam summary + reference**: Prompt 1 → Prompt 2
**Multiple summaries** (midterm, final, etc.): Prompt 1 → Multiple Prompt 2 runs

## Troubleshooting: Wrong Workflow Chosen

### Problem: Used Prompt 3 but missed exam-critical content

**Solution**:
1. Use Prompt 1 to extract specific chapters you missed
2. Use Prompt 2 on those chapters to create focused additions
3. Integrate into existing summary

### Problem: Used Prompt 1 but now overwhelmed with content

**Solution**:
1. Get old exams or clear exam focus information
2. Use Prompt 2 with comprehensive planning phase
3. Let Prompt 2's Phase 1 do the hard prioritization work

### Problem: Used Prompt 2 but structure plan needs major revision

**Solution**:
1. Re-run Prompt 2 Phase 1 only with better old exam analysis
2. Present revised structure to yourself for approval
3. Execute Phase 2 with better plan

### Problem: Used Prompt 3 but prioritization was off

**Solution**:
1. Identify what was missed (check against learning objectives)
2. Use Prompt 1 to extract missing chapters only
3. Integrate or create supplementary summary section

## Recommendations by Course Type

### Math-Heavy Courses (Analysis, Linear Algebra, Statistics)

**Recommended**: Prompt 1 → Prompt 2
**Reason**: Math content benefits from complete extraction (all derivations), then careful reduction with specialty_math.txt enhancements

**OR** Prompt 3 if old exams show clear patterns (e.g., "always 3 proof questions, 4 calculation questions")

### Programming Courses (Data Structures, Algorithms, OOP)

**Recommended**: Prompt 3 (if have old exams) or Prompt 2
**Reason**: Code examples are high-value, lectures often have redundancy. Prioritization helps focus on tested algorithms/patterns.

Apply specialty_programming.txt enhancements.

### Theory-Heavy Courses (Databases, Networks, OS)

**Recommended**: Prompt 2 or Prompt 3
**Reason**: Benefit from careful planning to identify exam-tested vs. background material. Often have extensive reading that isn't all tested.

### Mixed Theory/Practice Courses (Embedded Systems, Web Dev)

**Recommended**: Prompt 3 if confident, else Prompt 1 → Prompt 2
**Reason**: Need to balance theory and code. Good planning essential. Prompt 3 works if you understand the balance.

### Courses with Unclear Exam Format

**Recommended**: Prompt 1 → (wait for clarity) → Prompt 2
**Reason**: Safe approach. Extract everything, optimize later when exam format becomes clear.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Using Prompt 3 too early

**Problem**: Don't have old exams yet, guess at priorities
**Result**: Miss exam-critical content, include irrelevant content
**Solution**: Use Prompt 1 first, then Prompt 3 when have old exams

### ❌ Mistake 2: Using Prompt 1 too late

**Problem**: 3 days until exam, extract everything (too slow)
**Result**: Not enough time to create summary
**Solution**: Use Prompt 3 for fast track

### ❌ Mistake 3: Skipping planning phase

**Problem**: Use Prompt 2 or 3 but skip Phase 1 approval
**Result**: Poor structure, missing KRs, inefficient organization
**Solution**: ALWAYS complete and approve planning phase

### ❌ Mistake 4: Wrong granularity

**Problem**: Use Prompt 3 for complex course without deep old exam analysis
**Result**: Prioritization errors, content gaps
**Solution**: Use Prompt 1 → Prompt 2 for complex courses unless very confident

### ❌ Mistake 5: Not using combinations

**Problem**: Think you can only use one workflow
**Result**: Sub-optimal results
**Solution**: Combine workflows (e.g., Prompt 3 for main summary, Prompt 1 for specific missing chapters)

## Questions?

If unsure which workflow to use, ask yourself:

**"Do I want completeness or efficiency?"**
- Completeness → Prompt 1 → Prompt 2
- Efficiency → Prompt 3

**"Do I know exactly what's on the exam?"**
- Yes → Prompt 3
- No → Prompt 1 → Prompt 2

**"How much time do I have?"**
- Plenty → Prompt 1 → Prompt 2
- Limited → Prompt 3

**When in doubt, start with Prompt 1.** You can always use Prompt 2 later for optimization.

Good luck! 📚✨
