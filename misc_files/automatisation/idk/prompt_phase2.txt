# PROMPT: PHASE 2 - EXAM-FOCUSED SUMMARIZATION

Use this prompt to transform complete LaTeX files from Phase 1 into concise, exam-ready summaries with KRs and examples.

---

## FULL PROMPT

```
Create an exam-focused summary from the complete LaTeX file: [FILENAME.tex]

COURSE CONTEXT:
- Course name: [Full course name and code]
- Chapter/Topic: [e.g., "Chapter 3: Database Normalization"]
- Exam format: [e.g., "Written exam, 2 hours, 40% theory questions, 60% practical problems"]
- Allowed materials: [e.g., "One A4 sheet handwritten notes"]

---

CONTENT STRATEGY:

!! Follow the new table of contents from Phase 1.5 analysis !!
For each chapter/section in the Phase 1.5 structure:
1. Extract relevant content from Phase 1 files
2. Summarize and condense to focus on exam-relevant material
3. Add KR blocks for all practical skills
4. Add 2-3 example exercises per major topic

WHAT TO KEEP:
- Essential definitions (core concepts from learning objectives)
- Key theorems/rules (frequently referenced or foundational)
- Critical distinctions (differences between similar concepts)
- Important formulas (those applied in exam problems)
- Common pitfalls and edge cases
- Exam-relevant examples

WHAT TO REMOVE:
- Historical background (unless specifically tested)
- Overly detailed derivations (keep results only, unless proof is commonly tested)
- Redundant examples (keep only the most instructive 2-3)
- Tangential remarks not connected to learning objectives
- Extended motivations or introductions
- Verbose explanations (make concise)

WHAT TO ADD:
- Kochrezepte (KR blocks) for every practical skill
- 2-3 example exercises per major topic
- Quick reference tables for comparing concepts
- Memory aids, mnemonics, visual patterns where helpful

TARGET LENGTH: 30-50% of original Phase 1 content

KR (KOCHREZEPT) CREATION:

For every type of problem students need to solve, create a KR block:

\begin{KR}{How to [Task Name]}\\
\textbf{Given:} [What information you start with]
\textbf{Goal:} [What you're solving for]

\textbf{Procedure:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [Clear, actionable step with formula if applicable]
    \item [Decision point: "If X > Y, then do A; otherwise do B"]
    \item [Reference to relevant theorems/definitions]
    \item [Verification or sanity check step]
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Common mistakes:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [Mistake 1: description and how to avoid it]
    \item [Mistake 2: description and how to avoid it]
\end{itemize}
\end{KR}

KR EXAMPLES BY TOPIC:
- Math: "How to prove convergence by induction"
- CS: "How to implement binary search"
- Databases: "How to normalize a table to 3NF"
- Engineering: "How to calculate circuit resistance"

KR GUIDELINES:
- Write at the level of someone solving an exam problem
- Include ALL steps, even "obvious" ones
- Note where students commonly make errors
- Keep language concise but complete
- Reference other blocks if needed: "see definition 2.3"

---

EXAMPLE CREATION:

Add 2-3 example exercises per major topic:

\begin{example2}{[Problem Type/Topic]}\\
\textbf{Task:} [Clear problem statement]

\textbf{Given:} [All provided information with notation]

[Provide any necessary context, data, or constraints]

\tcblower

\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [Step 1 with explanation]
    \item [Step 2: show intermediate results]
    \item [Step 3: explain key decisions]
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Final answer:} [Clearly stated result]

\important{Key insight:} [What makes this solution work / technique to remember]
\end{example2}

EXAMPLE SELECTION CRITERIA:
- Cover the most common exam question formats
- Span difficulty levels: 1 easy, 1 medium, 1 challenging per major topic
- Illustrate different aspects of the concept
- Include edge cases or tricky scenarios
- Match the actual exam style (if past exams available)

---

STRUCTURE OPTIMIZATION:

CRITICAL: The summary does NOT need to follow lecture order. Reorganize content into the structure that makes most sense for learning and exam preparation.

LOGICAL GROUPING:
- Cluster related concepts together (even if from different lectures)
- Group by conceptual relationships, not chronological order
- Put prerequisites before dependent concepts
- Place most-tested topics prominently
- Create thematic sections that make intuitive sense

REORGANIZATION PRINCIPLES:
- If lectures covered Topic A in week 2 and Topic B in week 5, but they're closely related → group them together
- If a concept was introduced briefly early and expanded later → consolidate into one coherent section
- If topics naturally form a progression (basic → intermediate → advanced) → structure that way regardless of lecture order
- If exam focuses on certain combinations of topics → structure to facilitate that synthesis

EXAMPLE REORGANIZATION:
Lecture order: Introduction, History, Theory A, Applications, Theory B, More Applications
Better structure: Introduction, Theory A & B (grouped conceptually), All Applications (consolidated)

SECTION SIMPLIFICATION:
- Merge subsections that are very short (<3 blocks)
- Eliminate excessive nesting
- Use \paragraph{} instead of \subsubsection{} where appropriate
- Avoid redundancy (no subsection if only one definition block)

LAYOUT OPTIMIZATION:
\mult{2}
\begin{definition}{Concept A}\\
[Concise definition]
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}{Concept B}\\
[Concise definition]
\end{definition}
\multend

\begin{KR}{When to use A vs B}\\
[Decision criteria]
\end{KR}

\begin{example2}{Applying A and B}\\
[Problem demonstrating both]
\tcblower
[Solution showing decision-making]
\end{example2}

IMAGE HANDLING:

Review all TODO comments from Phase 1:
- REMOVE images marked as SUPPLEMENTARY (unless exam-critical)
- KEEP all CRITICAL and IMPORTANT images
- Update priority if exam relevance changed

Example priority update:
% TODO: Add image from Lecture_03.pdf, Slide 15
% Description: Normalization dependency diagram
% Priority: CRITICAL (appears frequently in exam questions)
% Suggested filename: 03_normalization_dependency.png
\\
% \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{03_normalization_dependency.png}
\\
% WHEN YOU ADD IMAGE: Uncomment line above

Keep all \includegraphics lines COMMENTED OUT!

If image can be replaced with LaTeX table or simple text:
% ALTERNATIVE: This shows simple 2×2 table - consider LaTeX tabular instead
% TODO: Add image OR create table below

Updated image summary at end:
% ===== IMAGE SUMMARY (POST-SUMMARIZATION) =====
% Images retained: [X] (down from [Y] in Phase 1)
% CRITICAL: [A]
% IMPORTANT: [B]
% Images removed: [Z] (all supplementary)
%
% Extraction checklist:
% [ ] [Source, Page] - [description] (PRIORITY)
% =====================

CONTENT QUALITY STANDARDS:

FOR DEFINITIONS:
- Keep formal definition if precise wording matters
- Otherwise, use clear explanatory prose
- Include "Intuition:" or "In practice:" remarks
- Note relationships to other concepts
- Definitions for similar things can be merged into one block

FOR THEOREMS:
- State the theorem clearly
- Include conditions/prerequisites
- Give intuition for when/why it applies
- Omit proof unless commonly tested
- Reference where it's used in KRs/examples

FOR EXAMPLES:
- Must be solvable with content in the summary
- Show complete solution path
- Highlight decision points
- Note alternative approaches if relevant
- Connect to exam-style problems

GENERAL:
- Focus on KR! Every practical skill must have a KR block

---

PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:

MUST KEEP UNCHANGED:
- Image TODO comments (with all details)
- Commented \includegraphics lines
- Environment names and formatting
- \\ placement rules
- lstlisting language specifications
- Mathematical notation
- Multi-column groupings that work well

---

VALIDATION BEFORE DELIVERY:

Ask yourself:
- [ ] Could student solve typical exam problems with only this summary?
- [ ] Are there any "memory gaps" that would cause exam struggles?
- [ ] Is every practical skill covered by a KR?
- [ ] Are examples representative of real exam questions?
- [ ] Is anything included that has never appeared on exam or exercises?

---

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

Deliver:
1. Summarized .tex file (same filename as input)
2. Brief change log noting:
   - Major sections removed/merged
   - Number of KRs added: [count]
   - Number of examples added: [count]
   - Estimated length reduction: [percentage]
   - Image changes: [kept X, removed Y]

FILENAME: Keep same as input file (XX_topic_name.tex)
```

## CUSTOMIZATION BY EXAM TYPE

### Theory-Heavy Exams

```
Add to prompt:

Focus on definitions and conceptual distinctions.
Create KRs for essay structure and argumentation.
Examples should be comparative analysis or application of frameworks.
Emphasize "explain the concept" rather than "calculate the answer."
```

### Calculation/Problem-Solving Exams

```
Add to prompt:

Emphasize KRs heavily - every formula needs a solution recipe.
Examples must cover different problem variants.
Include common calculation errors and how to avoid them.
Note calculator shortcuts where applicable.
```

### Mixed Format Exams

```
Add to prompt:

Balance theory definitions with practical KRs.
Ensure examples show BOTH "explain concept" and "apply concept" types.
Include both conceptual questions and calculation problems.
```

---

## REFINEMENT PROMPTS

Use these if you need to adjust the summary:

**If still too long:**
```
Reduce section [X] by 30%. Cut: background, redundant examples,
verbose explanations. Keep: KRs, 1-2 examples, key definitions.
```

**If missing KRs:**
```
Add KRs for these skills: [list]. Include steps, decision points,
common mistakes for each.
```

**If need better examples:**
```
Add exam-style example for [topic]: [difficulty level: easy/medium/hard],
complete solution with step-by-step reasoning, highlight key technique.
```
