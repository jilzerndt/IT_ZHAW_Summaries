## STEP 3: PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS

In the Project "Custom Instructions" field, add:

```
This project creates exam-focused LaTeX summaries following layout_and_colours.sty.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. Always use appropriate tcolorbox environments (definition, concept, KR, example2, etc.)
2. Add \\ after environment titles (EXCEPT before itemize/enumerate)
3. ALWAYS comment out \includegraphics lines (prefix with %)
4. All lstlisting must have [language=X, style=base]
5. In lstlisting: use ae/oe/ue NOT ä/ö/ü
6. Create one .tex file per major section/topic

WORKFLOW:
- Phase 0: Foundation files (00_intro.tex, 00_table_of_contents.tex)
- Phase 1: Extract content from sources
- Phase 2: Summarize and add KRs/examples
- Phase 3: Validate syntax and style

ALWAYS refer to the prompt files in Project Knowledge for detailed instructions.
```

---

## STEP 4: ORGANIZE YOUR FILES LOCALLY

Create this folder structure:

```
/CourseName_Summary/
  main.tex
  /content/
    00_intro.tex
    00_table_of_contents.tex
    01_topic.tex
    02_topic.tex
    ...
    /images/
      /01_intro/
      /02_basics/
      ...
  /misc_files/
    /LateX/
      layout_and_colours.sty
  /source_materials/
    /lectures/
      Lecture_01.pdf
      Lecture_02.pdf
      ...
    /exercises/
      Exercise_Sheet_01.pdf
      ...
    syllabus.pdf
    exam_info.pdf
```

---

## STEP 5: CREATE MAIN.TEX

Create your main.tex file:

```latex
\documentclass[a4paper, fontsize = 8pt, landscape]{scrartcl}
\usepackage{../misc_files/LateX/layout_and_colours}

\makeatletter
\def\input@path{{content/}}
\makeatother
\graphicspath{{content/images/}}

\title{Course Name}
\subtitle{Exam Summary}
\author{Your Name}
\date{Semester Year}

\createtitlepagestyle
\createmainpagestyle

\begin{document}
\begin{multicols}{2}
    \thispagestyle{TitlePageStyle}
    \maketitleinfo
    \sffamily
    
    % Phase 0 files
    \input{00_intro.tex}
    \raggedcolumns
    \pagebreak
    
    \input{00_table_of_contents.tex}
    \raggedcolumns
    \pagebreak
    
    % Content chapters (add as you create them)
    % \input{01_introduction.tex}
    % \raggedcolumns
    % \pagebreak
    
    % \input{02_basics.tex}
    % \raggedcolumns
    % \pagebreak
    
\end{multicols}
\end{document}
```

---

## STEP 6: TEST COMPILATION

Test that everything works:

```bash
# Compile main.tex
pdflatex main.tex

# If errors, check:
# - Path to layout_and_colours.sty correct?
# - All required packages installed?
# - No syntax errors in main.tex?
```

---

## STEP 7: READY TO START

You're now ready to begin! Follow this sequence:

1. **Gather all course materials**
   - PDFs of lectures, slides, scripts
   - Exercise sheets
   - Syllabus and exam information
   - Past exams if available

2. **Upload to Claude conversation**
   - You can attach files to individual messages
   - OR reference files if they're in Project Knowledge

3. **Start with Phase 0**
   - Create 00_intro.tex (course info)
   - Create 00_table_of_contents.tex (outline)

4. **Process each chapter**
   - Phase 1: Extract
   - Phase 2: Summarize
   - Phase 3: Validate
   - Add to main.tex

5. **Extract images as you go or at the end**

6. **Compile final PDF**

## USAGE TIPS

### Starting a New Conversation

When you start a new conversation in the project:

```
I'm working on [Chapter X: Topic] for my [Course Name] summary.

[Attach source PDF or describe what you have]

Please use [PROMPT: Phase 1] to extract the content.
```

Claude will automatically have access to:
- All Project Knowledge files
- The custom instructions
- The prompt templates

### Switching Between Phases

```
I've completed Phase 1 for Chapter 3. Here's the file:

[paste content or attach]

Please use [PROMPT: Phase 2] to create an exam-focused summary.

Course context:
- Exam format: [describe]
- High-priority topics: [list if known]
```

### Requesting Validation

```
Please validate this chapter using [PROMPT: Phase 3]:

[attach or paste file]

Focus especially on [any specific concerns].
```

### Requesting Refinements

```
The summary is still too long. Please reduce section [X] by 30% 
following the guidelines in [PROMPT: Phase 2].
```

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING SETUP

### Problem: Claude doesn't reference Project Knowledge

**Solution:** Explicitly mention files:
```
Please refer to [PROMPT: Phase 1] in Project Knowledge for the 
extraction guidelines.
```

### Problem: Style sheet not working

**Check:**
1. Is layout_and_colours.sty in Project Knowledge?
2. Does main.tex have correct path to .sty file?
3. Are all required LaTeX packages installed?

### Problem: Prompts seem incomplete

**Solution:** All prompt files should be in Project Knowledge. Re-upload if needed.

### Problem: Claude uses wrong formatting

**Reminder in conversation:**
```
Remember to follow layout_and_colours.sty conventions:
- \\ after titles (not before lists)
- Comment out all \includegraphics
- lstlisting needs [language=X, style=base]
```

---

## MAINTENANCE

### After Each Course

1. **Archive completed summary:**
   ```
   /completed_summaries/
     /2024-FS-DatabaseSystems/
       [all files]
       README.md (notes on what worked)
   ```

2. **Update Project Knowledge:**
   - Add successful summary as example
   - Remove outdated examples
   - Update course-specific notes

3. **Document lessons learned:**
   - What prompts worked best?
   - Any course-specific quirks?
   - Time estimates accurate?

### Improving Over Time

1. **Build personal library:**
   ```
   /templates/
     /KRs/
       sorting_algorithms.tex
       proof_techniques.tex
     /examples/
       database_queries.tex
       algorithm_traces.tex
   ```

2. **Refine prompts:**
   - Note which prompt modifications helped
   - Create course-type specific variants
   - Share successful patterns

3. **Track metrics:**
   - Time per chapter
   - First-compile success rate
   - Exam performance correlation

## BEST PRACTICES

### During the Semester

**Incremental approach:**
- Create summary as course progresses
- Week 1: Phase 0 + Chapter 1
- Week 2: Chapter 2
- ...
- Pre-exam: Just review and minor updates

**Benefits:**
- Spread work over semester
- Less pre-exam stress
- Better retention (creating = learning)

### Collaboration

**If working with study group:**
1. One person sets up Project
2. Share prompts and conventions
3. Divide chapters among group
4. Each person validates their chapters
5. Combine into single document
6. Cross-review for consistency

### Quality Over Speed

**Don't rush:**
- Phase 1: Take time to capture everything
- Phase 2: Think critically about exam relevance
- Phase 3: Thorough validation prevents headaches

**Better to spend:**
- 3 hours on high-quality chapter
- Than 1 hour + 2 hours debugging later

## ADVANCED TIPS

### Custom Prompt Modifications

For specialized courses, modify base prompts:

**Heavy math course:**
```
Add to Phase 1 prompt:
"Use highlight{} blocks for formula collections.
Include theorem statements but omit proofs unless critical.
Use align* for multi-step derivations."
```

**Programming course:**
```
Add to Phase 1 prompt:
"Include Big-O complexity for all algorithms.
Show execution traces in examples.
Note common bugs and edge cases."
```

**Theory-heavy course:**
```
Add to Phase 2 prompt:
"Focus on definitions and distinctions.
Create KRs for essay structure and argumentation.
Examples should be comparative analysis."
```

### Automation Scripts

**Image extraction script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Extract images from PDF at specific pages

while IFS=',' read -r pdf page filename; do
    magick convert -density 300 \
        "$pdf[$page]" \
        -quality 90 \
        "content/images/$filename"
done < image_list.csv
```

**Compile script:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Quick compile with error handling

pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode main.tex

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✓ Compilation successful"
    open main.pdf
else
    echo "✗ Compilation failed - check errors"
    grep -A 5 "!" main.log
fi
```

### Multi-Course Projects

**Reusing across courses:**

1. Create base Project template
2. Clone for each new course
3. Adjust custom instructions per course
4. Share common KR/example libraries

**Folder structure:**
```
/Summaries/
  /shared/
    layout_and_colours.sty
    common_algorithms.tex
    proof_templates.tex
  /Course1/
    [course-specific files]
  /Course2/
    [course-specific files]
```

## GETTING HELP

### If Something Doesn't Work

1. **Check Project Knowledge:**
   - Are all required files present?
   - Is style sheet uploaded correctly?

2. **Check Custom Instructions:**
   - Are critical rules listed?
   - Any typos or outdated info?

3. **Test with Simple Example:**
   - Try Phase 1 on single lecture slide
   - Verify output follows format
   - Debug from there

4. **Ask Claude Explicitly:**
   ```
   I'm having issues with [specific problem].
   
   According to [PROMPT: Phase X], I should be getting [expected].
   Instead I'm getting [actual].
   
   Please help debug.
   ```

### Common Setup Mistakes

❌ **Forgot to comment out images:**
- Files won't compile
- Fix: Search for `\includegraphics` without `%` prefix

❌ **Wrong environment types:**
- Procedures in definition{} not KR{}
- Fix: Review REFERENCE: Style Guide

❌ **Missing language in lstlisting:**
- Code not highlighted properly
- Fix: Add [language=X, style=base]

❌ **Multiple topics in one file:**
- File too long and hard to navigate
- Fix: Split into separate files

## SUCCESS CHECKLIST

Your project is properly set up when:

- [ ] Project created with descriptive name
- [ ] layout_and_colours.sty in Project Knowledge
- [ ] All prompt files uploaded
- [ ] Reference files uploaded
- [ ] Custom instructions configured
- [ ] Local folder structure created
- [ ] main.tex created and compiles
- [ ] Test run of Phase 0 successful

**Time to setup: 30-60 minutes**

**You only do this once per course!**

After setup, actual summary creation is much faster: 1-3 hours per chapter vs 11-16 hours with old method.

---

## READY TO GO!

You're now ready to create efficient, high-quality LaTeX summaries!

**Start with:**
1. Gather course materials
2. Run Phase 0 (foundation files)
3. Process first chapter
4. Iterate and improve

**Remember:**
- Use the prompt files as templates
- Refer to style guide when uncertain
- Validate early and often
- Build incrementally

Good luck with your studies! 📚✨
