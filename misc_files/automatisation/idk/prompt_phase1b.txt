# PROMPT: EXERCISE & EXAM PREP CONTENT EXTRACTION

Use this prompt to extract EXERCISE and EXAM PREPARATION materials (exercise sheets, old exams, practice problems, Moodle quizzes) into properly formatted LaTeX files.

---

## FULL PROMPT

```
Extract exercise/exam content from [SOURCE_FILE.pdf] and create LaTeX file following layout_and_colours.sty.

SOURCE DESCRIPTION: [e.g., "Exercise Sheet 03" or "Old Exam FS2023" or "Moodle Quiz 02"]

CRITICAL FILE NAMING:
- Exercise sheets: exercise01.tex, exercise02.tex, ...
- Old exams: exam_FS2023.tex, exam_HS2022.tex, ...
- Practice materials: practice_normalization.tex, ...
- Moodle quizzes: quiz01.tex, quiz02.tex, ...

---

CONTENT EXTRACTION APPROACH:

For exercise/exam materials, follow the SAME formatting rules as Phase 1A, BUT with special focus on:

1. PROBLEM EXTRACTION
   Extract each exercise/question as example2{} block

2. SOLUTION EXTRACTION (if provided)
   Include solutions using \tcblower separator

3. PROBLEM TYPE IDENTIFICATION
   Note what TYPE of problem each is (for KR planning in Phase 1.5)

---

FORMATTING RULES (SAME AS PHASE 1A):
CONTENT AND STYLE GUIDELINES, FORMATTING RULES: follow instructions in file 'misc_files/automatisation/reference_style_guide.txt'
-> FIRST fully understand that document before starting!!

---

EXERCISE BLOCK STRUCTURE:

For each exercise/problem:

\begin{example2}{[Problem Type] - [Brief Description]}\\
\textbf{Source:} [Exercise Sheet X, Problem Y] or [Old Exam XXXX, Question Z]

\textbf{Topics:} [List topics tested - important for Phase 1.5 analysis]

\textbf{Problem:}
[Complete problem statement]

[Include any given data, constraints, context]

[IF SOLUTION PROVIDED:]
\tcblower

\textbf{Solution:}
[Complete solution with steps]

\textbf{Key concepts applied:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [Concept/technique 1]
    \item [Concept/technique 2]
\end{itemize}

\important{Problem type:} [Classification - e.g., "Normalization to 3NF", "Binary search implementation", "Proof by induction"]
\end{example2}

---

PROBLEM TYPE CLASSIFICATION:

CRITICAL: Identify and mark problem types clearly. This helps Phase 1.5 plan KRs.

Categories:
- **Calculation:** Numerical computation, formula application
- **Proof:** Mathematical proof, formal verification
- **Implementation:** Code writing, algorithm implementation
- **Analysis:** Complexity analysis, trade-off evaluation
- **Design:** System design, architecture decisions
- **Debugging:** Find and fix errors in given code
- **Explanation:** Describe concept, compare approaches
- **Application:** Apply theory to practical scenario

Example marking:
\important{Problem type:} Calculation - Database normalization to 3NF

---

OLD EXAM SPECIAL HANDLING:

For old exams, additionally note:

\begin{remark2}{Exam Metadata}\\
\textbf{Exam:} [Semester/Year]
\textbf{Total Points:} [If available]
\textbf{Time Allowed:} [If available]
\textbf{Question Distribution:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Theory questions: [X] points
    \item Practical problems: [Y] points
    \item Coding: [Z] points
\end{itemize}
\end{remark2}

Then extract each question as example2{} block.

---

MOODLE QUIZ SPECIAL HANDLING:

For Moodle quizzes/online assessments:

\begin{remark}
\textbf{Quiz Format:} [Multiple choice / Short answer / Mixed]
\textbf{Time Limit:} [If applicable]
\textbf{Topics Covered:} [List]
\end{remark}

Then extract each question. For multiple choice:

\begin{example2}{Multiple Choice - [Topic]}\\
\textbf{Question:}
[Question text]

\textbf{Options:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item [Option A]
    \item [Option B]
    \item [Option C]
    \item [Option D]
\end{enumerate}

\tcblower

\textbf{Correct Answer:} [Letter]

\textbf{Explanation:}
[Why this is correct, why others are wrong]
\end{example2}

---

CONTENT PRESERVATION:

- Extract ALL problems/questions - do NOT skip any
- Include ALL provided solutions or answer keys
- Preserve exact problem statements
- Note partial credit breakdowns if provided
- Include grading rubrics if available
- Mark difficulty levels if indicated

---

FILE ORGANIZATION:

FILENAME PATTERNS:
- Exercise sheets: exercise01.tex, exercise02.tex
- Old exams: exam_FS2023.tex, exam_HS2022.tex, exam_sample.tex
- Practice sets: practice_topic.tex
- Quizzes: quiz01.tex, quiz02.tex

FILE STRUCTURE:
- NO \documentclass or preamble
- Start with \section{Exercise Sheet X} or \section{Exam FS2023}
- Group problems by topic if beneficial
- Otherwise, extract in order presented

Example structure:
\section{Exercise Sheet 03}

\subsection{Normalization Problems}
[Problems 1-3]

\subsection{Query Optimization}
[Problems 4-6]

---

PROBLEM SUMMARY SECTION:

At the END of each file, include:

% ===== PROBLEM TYPE SUMMARY =====

VALIDATION BEFORE DELIVERY:

- [ ] VALDIATION CHECKLIST from 'misc_files/automatisation/reference_style_guide.txt'
- [ ] All problems extracted completely
- [ ] Solutions included where available
- [ ] Problem types clearly marked
- [ ] Topics identified for each problem
- [ ] All formatting rules followed (same as Phase 1A)
- [ ] Problem summary section present at end
- [ ] Images commented out with TODO
- [ ] Filename follows naming convention

---

OUTPUT:

Deliver complete exerciseXX.tex or exam_XXXX.tex file ready for Phase 1.5 analysis.

These files provide crucial information about:
- What problem types appear on exams
- Which topics are tested practically
- What skill levels are expected
- Question formats and patterns
```

---

## WHY PHASE 1B MATTERS

### Critical for Phase 1.5 Planning:

1. **KR Identification:** Problem types directly map to needed KRs
   - Implementation problems → Need "How to implement X" KR
   - Calculation problems → Need "How to calculate Y" KR

2. **Example Planning:** Actual exam problems become summary examples
   - Old exam questions show exact format expected
   - Exercise problems show practice progression

3. **Priority Setting:** Frequency of topics in exercises/exams indicates importance
   - Topic in 80% of old exams → High priority
   - Topic rarely tested → Low priority

4. **Structure Optimization:** Exercise patterns reveal optimal organization
   - Problems mixing Topic A + B → Should be adjacent in summary
   - Sequential problem types → Natural chapter flow

## SPECIAL CASES

### Exercise Sheet with No Solutions:

```
\begin{example2}{[Problem Type]}\\
\textbf{Problem:}
[Problem statement]

\important{Solution not provided - will need to solve during Phase 2}
\important{Problem type:} [Classification]
\end{example2}
```

### Old Exam with Partial Information:

```
\begin{remark}
\textbf{Note:} This exam reconstruction may be incomplete. 
Questions based on [student notes / partial scan / memory].
\end{remark}
```

### Practice Problem with Multiple Approaches:

```
\tcblower

\textbf{Solution Approach 1:}
[Method 1]

\textbf{Solution Approach 2:}
[Method 2]

\textbf{Comparison:}
- Approach 1: [pros/cons]
- Approach 2: [pros/cons]
```

## INTEGRATION WITH PHASE 1A

After completing both:
- Phase 1A: All theory materials (lectures, scripts) extracted
- Phase 1B: All practice materials (exercises, exams) extracted

→ Ready for Phase 1.5: Comprehensive analysis of ALL materials to propose optimal summary structure!
