# COMPLETE WORKFLOW GUIDE

Step-by-step process from course materials to exam-ready PDF.

---

## PREPARATION (One-time per course)

### 1. Analyze Context Files and Prompts
- Fully Analyze Files to Project Knowledge (listed in the file 'index_all_files.txt')

### 2. Course Materials
- Quickly analyze provided course materials: lectures, exercises, old exams, quizzes, etc. 

---

## PHASE 0: FOUNDATION FILES

### Create 00_intro.tex
- Use PROMPT: Phase 0 Part A
- Include: course materials, course info, exam details, grading, assignments

### Create 00_table_of_contents.tex
- Use PROMPT: Phase 0 Part B
- Include: all chapters, structure, planned KRs

### Update 00_table_of_contents.tex
- Use PROMPT: Phase 0 Part B 
- Rerun after adding new course materials to update contents of 00_intro.tex

### Create main.tex
```latex
\documentclass[a4paper, fontsize = 8pt, landscape]{scrartcl}
\usepackage{path/to/layout_and_colours}

\makeatletter
\def\input@path{{content/}}
\makeatother
\graphicspath{{content/images/}}

\title{Course Name}
\author{Your Name}
\date{Semester}

\createtitlepagestyle
\createmainpagestyle

\begin{document}
\begin{multicols}{2}
    \thispagestyle{TitlePageStyle}
    \maketitle
    \sffamily
    
    \input{00_intro.tex}
    \raggedcolumns
    \pagebreak
    
    \input{00_table_of_contents.tex}
    \raggedcolumns
    \pagebreak
    
    % Add chapters here
    
\end{multicols}
\end{document}
```

## PHASE 1: EXTRACTION

1. Verify relevant course materials available (listed in 00_intro.tex under "Course Materials")
   - Identify if it is THEORETICAL (Phase 1A) or EXERCISE/EXAM (Phase 1B)
   - Create new file '00_extraction_checklist.tex' with a list of relevant course materials for each phase (1A and 1B) that can be used to track progress
   - "Relevant" means it contains content that should be included in the final summary (e.g., lectures, scripts, exercises, old exams) but not administrative documents or unrelated materials
   - If file already exists, and we are re-running Phase 1, check if all relevant files listed in 00_intro.tex under "Course Materials" are already extracted. If not, add to checklist.

2. **Use PROMPT: Phase 1A**
   - Go through each file in the checklist for Phase 1A
   - Input: [SOURCE_FILE.pdf]
   - Extract content to LaTeX following the instrructions in the prompt

3. **Output: XX_topic_name.tex**
   - Complete content
   - All images in TODO comments (commented out)
   - One LateX file per course material file (split long files as needed)

4. **Quick validation:**
   - Proper \section{} structure?
   - lstlisting formatted correctly?
   - Images commented out?

5. Mark as DONE in checklist

6. Repeat steps 2-5 for all files in Phase 1A checklist

7. **Use PROMPT: Phase 1B**
   - Go through each file in the checklist for Phase 1B
   - Input: [SOURCE_FILE.pdf]
   - Extract content to LaTeX following the instrructions in the prompt

8. **Output: XX_exercises.tex, XX_old_exams.tex, etc**
   - Complete content
   - All images in TODO comments (commented out)
   - One LateX file per course material file (split long files as needed)

9. **Quick validation:**
   - Proper \section{} structure?
   - lstlisting formatted correctly?
   - Images commented out?

10. Mark as DONE in checklist

11. Repeat steps 7-10 for all files in Phase 1B checklist

---

## PHASE 1.5: STRUCTURE PLANNING

### Purpose:
Analyze all Phase 1 content and propose optimal summary structure BEFORE starting Phase 2 summarization.

### For ALL extracted chapters:

1. **Use PROMPT: Phase 1.5**
   - Input: All in Phase 1A and Phase 1B generated .tex files
   - Specify exam format and priorities
   - Request structure analysis

2. **Output: Structure Proposal**
   - Proposed chapter reorganization
   - KR inventory (complete list)
   - Content reduction analysis
   - Dependency mapping

3. **YOUR REVIEW (Critical!):**
   - Does chapter structure make sense?
   - Are priorities aligned with exam?
   - Any missing topics/KRs?
   - Any wrong groupings?
   - Comfortable with content cuts?

4. **Provide feedback:**
   - ✅ Approve as-is
   - 📝 Request specific changes
   - ❓ Ask clarifications

5. **Claude adjusts if needed**

6. **Final approval**

7. **Create '00_summary_structure.tex'** with final chapter list and titles

8. **proceed to Phase 2**

---

## PHASE 2: SUMMARIZATION

### For each chapter (using approved Phase 1.5 structure):

1. **Use PROMPT: Phase 2**
   - Input: All in Phase 1A and Phase 1B generated .tex files, '00_summary_structure.tex'
   - Specify exam format
   - Note high-priority topics

2. **Output: Condensed file (As short and concise as possible without losing relevant information)**
   - Only exam-relevant content
   - KRs for all procedures
   - 2-3 examples per topic

3. **Check:**
   - Has KR for every skill?
   - 2-3 examples per major topic?
   - Only exam-relevant content?
   - Image TODOs still intact?
   - Structure reorganized logically (not just lecture order)?

---

## PHASE 3: VALIDATION

### For each chapter:

1. **Use PROMPT: Phase 3**
   - Run full validation
   - Review validation report

2. **Fix errors:**
   - Priority 1 (critical): MUST fix
   - Priority 2 (style): SHOULD fix
   - Request auto-fix if needed

3. **Verify:**
   - All environments closed?
   - Images commented out?
   - No syntax errors?

---

## INTEGRATION

### Add chapters to main.tex
```latex
\input{01_intro.tex}
\raggedcolumns
\pagebreak

\input{02_basics.tex}
\raggedcolumns
\pagebreak

% ... etc
```

### Test compile each chapter individually
- Comment out all other chapters
- Compile to catch errors early
- Uncomment when working

---

## FINAL COMPILATION

### Full build:
1. Uncomment all chapters in main.tex
2. Ensure all critical images added
3. Compile full document
4. Review PDF:
   - Layout correct?
   - Page breaks sensible?
   - Images display?
   - No overflow text?

### If errors:
- Use Phase 3 troubleshooting
- Check error line number
- Verify environment nesting
- Test compile problem section alone

---

## REFINEMENT PROMPTS

**Content too long:**
```
Reduce section [X] by 30%. Cut: background, redundant 
examples, verbose text. Keep: KRs, 1-2 examples, key definitions.
```

**Missing KRs:**
```
Add KRs for skills: [list]. Include steps, decision points, 
common mistakes.
```

**Need better examples:**
```
Add exam-style example for [topic]: [difficulty level], 
complete solution, highlight key technique.
```

**Style issues:**
```
Fix style violations: [list issues]. Provide corrected snippets.
```

**Image checklist:**
```
Generate image extraction table from [file.tex] with all TODO 
comments in table format for batch processing.
```

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**Compilation fails:**
```
Error: [ERROR MESSAGE]

Identify likely cause, check lines around error, suggest fix.
```

**Images prevent build:**
```
Check all \includegraphics are commented out. Find any 
uncommented lines in [file].
```

**Missing content:**
```
Check page X of [source PDF] - the [topic] section seems missing.
```

**Format inconsistencies:**
```
Review [file] for style consistency: environment usage, spacing, 
\mult{2} groupings.
```
