# COMPLETE WORKFLOW GUIDE

Step-by-step process from course materials to exam-ready PDF.

---

## PREPARATION (One-time per course)

### 1. Setup Claude Project
- Create new Project for course
- Add relevant Files to Project Knowledge

### 2. Gather Materials
- All PDFs (slides, scripts, textbooks)
- Exercise sheets + solutions
- Previous exams
- Syllabus and course outline

### 3. Create main.tex
```latex
\documentclass[a4paper, fontsize = 8pt, landscape]{scrartcl}
\usepackage{path/to/layout_and_colours}

\makeatletter
\def\input@path{{content/}}
\makeatother
\graphicspath{{content/images/}}

\title{Course Name}
\author{Your Name}
\date{Semester}

\createtitlepagestyle
\createmainpagestyle

\begin{document}
\begin{multicols}{2}
    \thispagestyle{TitlePageStyle}
    \maketitle
    \sffamily
    
    \input{00_intro.tex}
    \raggedcolumns
    \pagebreak
    
    \input{00_table_of_contents.tex}
    \raggedcolumns
    \pagebreak
    
    % Add chapters here
    
\end{multicols}
\end{document}
```

## PHASE 0: FOUNDATION FILES

**Time: 45-90 minutes**

### Create 00_intro.tex
- Use PROMPT: Phase 0 Part A
- Include: course info, exam details, grading, assignments
- Time: 15-30 min

### Create 00_table_of_contents.tex
- Use PROMPT: Phase 0 Part B
- Include: all chapters, structure, planned KRs
- Time: 30-60 min

### Add to main.tex
```latex
\input{00_intro.tex}
\raggedcolumns
\pagebreak
\input{00_table_of_contents.tex}
\raggedcolumns
\pagebreak
```

---

## PHASE 1: EXTRACTION

**Time: 15-60 min per chapter**

### For each chapter:

1. **Use PROMPT: Phase 1**
   - Attach source PDF
   - Specify topic clearly
   - Note if multiple topics (will create multiple files)

2. **Output: XX_topic_name.tex**
   - Complete content
   - All images in TODO comments (commented out)
   - One file per major section

3. **Quick validation:**
   - Proper \section{} structure?
   - lstlisting formatted correctly?
   - Images commented out?

4. **Optional: Batch extract images**
   - Review image summary at end of file
   - Extract all at once
   - Uncomment \includegraphics as you add each
   - OR wait until later

---

## PHASE 1.5: STRUCTURE PLANNING (NEW!)

**Time: 30-60 min analysis + 15-30 min your review**

### Purpose:
Analyze all Phase 1 content and propose optimal summary structure BEFORE starting Phase 2 summarization.

### For ALL extracted chapters:

1. **Use PROMPT: Phase 1.5**
   - Input: All Phase 1 .tex files
   - Specify exam format and priorities
   - Request structure analysis

2. **Output: Structure Proposal**
   - Proposed chapter reorganization
   - KR inventory (complete list)
   - Example distribution plan
   - Content reduction analysis
   - Dependency mapping
   - Exam alignment matrix

3. **YOUR REVIEW (Critical!):**
   - Does chapter structure make sense?
   - Are priorities aligned with exam?
   - Any missing topics/KRs?
   - Any wrong groupings?
   - Comfortable with content cuts?

4. **Provide feedback:**
   - ✅ Approve as-is
   - 📝 Request specific changes
   - ❓ Ask clarifications

5. **Claude adjusts if needed**

6. **Final approval → proceed to Phase 2**

### Why This Matters:

- **Catch structural issues early** (before hours of Phase 2 work)
- **You control final organization** (verify it makes sense)
- **Clearer Phase 2 execution** (following approved roadmap)
- **Time savings** (1-2 hrs planning saves 2-3 hrs revision)

### When to Use:

✅ **Always use for:**
- First course with this system
- Complex multi-topic courses
- Uncertain about optimal structure

⚠️ **Can skip for:**
- Very simple courses (< 5 chapters)
- Obvious linear structure
- Strong existing outline

---

## PHASE 2: SUMMARIZATION

**Time: 30-90 min per chapter**

### For each chapter (using approved Phase 1.5 structure):

1. **Use PROMPT: Phase 2**
   - Input: complete file from Phase 1
   - Specify exam format
   - Note high-priority topics

2. **Output: Condensed file (30-50% shorter)**
   - Only exam-relevant content
   - KRs for all procedures
   - 2-3 examples per topic

3. **Check:**
   - Has KR for every skill?
   - 2-3 examples per major topic?
   - Only exam-relevant content?
   - Image TODOs still intact?
   - Structure reorganized logically (not just lecture order)?

4. **Note reorganizations made:**
   - Which topics were grouped together?
   - What order changes improve understanding?
   - Does structure facilitate exam preparation?

---

## PHASE 3: VALIDATION

**Time: 10-30 min per chapter**

### For each chapter:

1. **Use PROMPT: Phase 3**
   - Run full validation
   - Review validation report

2. **Fix errors:**
   - Priority 1 (critical): MUST fix
   - Priority 2 (style): SHOULD fix
   - Request auto-fix if needed

3. **Verify:**
   - All environments closed?
   - Images commented out?
   - No syntax errors?

---

## INTEGRATION

### Add chapters to main.tex
```latex
\input{01_intro.tex}
\raggedcolumns
\pagebreak

\input{02_basics.tex}
\raggedcolumns
\pagebreak

% ... etc
```

### Test compile each chapter individually
- Comment out all other chapters
- Compile to catch errors early
- Uncomment when working

---

## IMAGE EXTRACTION

**Can be done at any point**

### Option A: After Phase 1 (each chapter)
- Extract images immediately
- Uncomment \includegraphics lines
- File compiles with images

### Option B: Batch at end (all chapters)
- Keep all images commented throughout
- Extract all images at once using summaries
- Uncomment all at final stage

### Process:
1. Review image summary in each .tex file
2. Open source PDF
3. Screenshot/export at exact location
4. Save with suggested filename
5. Place in /content/images/
6. Uncomment \includegraphics line (remove %)

---

## FINAL COMPILATION

### Full build:
1. Uncomment all chapters in main.tex
2. Ensure all critical images added
3. Compile full document
4. Review PDF:
   - Layout correct?
   - Page breaks sensible?
   - Images display?
   - No overflow text?

### If errors:
- Use Phase 3 troubleshooting
- Check error line number
- Verify environment nesting
- Test compile problem section alone

## BATCH PROCESSING STRATEGY

### Week 1: Foundation + Extraction
- Day 1-2: Setup, Phase 0
- Day 3-7: Phase 1 all chapters (1-2/day)

### Week 2: Summarization
- Day 1-7: Phase 2 all chapters (1-2/day)

### Week 3: Validation + Completion
- Day 1-3: Phase 3 all chapters
- Day 4-5: Image extraction
- Day 6-7: Final compilation, polish

---

## PARALLEL PROCESSING

**For faster wall-clock time:**

Open multiple Claude conversations:
- Conversation 1: Chapters 1-3 (Phase 1)
- Conversation 2: Chapters 4-6 (Phase 1)
- Conversation 3: Chapters 1-2 (Phase 2, after extraction)

**Caution:** Don't mix phases in same conversation

---

## REFINEMENT PROMPTS

**Content too long:**
```
Reduce section [X] by 30%. Cut: background, redundant 
examples, verbose text. Keep: KRs, 1-2 examples, key definitions.
```

**Missing KRs:**
```
Add KRs for skills: [list]. Include steps, decision points, 
common mistakes.
```

**Need better examples:**
```
Add exam-style example for [topic]: [difficulty level], 
complete solution, highlight key technique.
```

**Style issues:**
```
Fix style violations: [list issues]. Provide corrected snippets.
```

**Image checklist:**
```
Generate image extraction table from [file.tex] with all TODO 
comments in table format for batch processing.
```

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**Compilation fails:**
```
Error: [ERROR MESSAGE]

Identify likely cause, check lines around error, suggest fix.
```

**Images prevent build:**
```
Check all \includegraphics are commented out. Find any 
uncommented lines in [file].
```

**Missing content:**
```
Check page X of [source PDF] - the [topic] section seems missing.
```

**Format inconsistencies:**
```
Review [file] for style consistency: environment usage, spacing, 
\mult{2} groupings.
```

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

Track these to measure improvement:

- **Time per chapter:** Aim 3.5-5 hrs
- **First-compile success:** Aim >80%
- **Revisions needed:** Aim <3 per chapter
- **Exam preparation confidence:** Subjective but important
