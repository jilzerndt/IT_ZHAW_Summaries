Please help me rewrite and reformat LaTeX files for my course summary. Here's what you need to know:

Reference Materials

"Claude summary guidelines" file - Basic instructions
layout_and_colours.sty - Style definitions for LaTeX environments
main.tex - main LateX file for summary, contains the general structure of final document
examples of properly formatted content 
Additional context materials (lecture slides, etc.)
Preexisting summary which serves as a general guideline and structure (include all information found on there!)


Important formatting elements include:

All environment names (e.g., definition, concept, KR)
Double backslashes after environment titles (except for instances where an itemize or enumerate lists come right after the title)
keep image names and path exactly the same
Proper section/subsection hierarchy
Consistent spacing
logical grouping of content
for lstlisting blocks use [language=<language>, style=base] and only use english within those blockss

Please reformat each file following these guidelines, and:

Keep all information from original files
Add any missing information from the provided lecture materials
Add KRs (Kochrezepte) for typical exercise formats
Include example exercises
Consider all context files when rewriting
Follow the structure and logic from my example files (01_anforderungsanalyse.tex and 02_dom√§nenmodellierung.tex)

Structure Guidelines

Main sections with \section
Subsections and subsubsections where logical
Concepts grouped by theme
Examples after related theory
KRs for practical applications

Please use these instructions to rewrite my LaTeX summary files. The aim is to reformat and add missing information, not to shorten content. Please ensure all environments and spacing follow the layout_and_colours.sty guidelines.
