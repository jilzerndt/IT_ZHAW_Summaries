Please help me clean up all my summaries in this repo.

Structure of my repo: I have a very messy collection of the Semesters 1-3, which is why the contents are all in the subfolder '*subject*/old/' in each of the subjects from 1st-3rd Semester. I already created new folders in each subject for the new, cleaned up and structured content: '*subject*/LateX/'

The summaries for the 4th Semester are already in pretty good shape, so take these as an example of how I want my summaries to look like.

TODO:
- For each subject, create a clean and structured version of the current materials from the respective '*subject*/old/ and/or '*subject*/resources/' folders. This is NOT a summary, but a cleaned up and structured version of the existing materials, that contain all lecture materials, exercises, and additional resources. Location of the new materials: '*subject*/LateX/' with the main file being '*subject*/LateX/*subject*_zerndjil.tex'
- See the existing materials on how I use LateX and also the style sheet and example found in the directory 'misc_files/LateX/'

Start with the subject AN1 (Analysis 1).
