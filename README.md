# IT_ZHAW_Summaries

Hii!

We try to create helpful Summaries for the Bsc. in Computer Science at the ZHAW :D

main contributors:

Lucien Perret
Jil Zerndt

and everyone else who helped us set up this stuff and sent us their summaries <3

if you need additional materials or some old exercises/maybe some solutions here are the links for my onedrive folders for each semester:

[1st Semester](https://1drv.ms/f/c/afd97e7ad59da4bd/Er2kndV6ftkggK_G1wAAAAABtHiyXso7GRCRnor1hlx3bw?e=LNWanR)

[2nd Semester](https://1drv.ms/f/c/afd97e7ad59da4bd/Er2kndV6ftkggK9g_QAAAAABhQZ4Hnc_Q_qu4_9HnKrlow?e=9U21ve)

[3rd Semester](https://1drv.ms/f/c/afd97e7ad59da4bd/Er2kndV6ftkggK_J7gEAAAABFcn92fR31BmX3umK7N49pQ?e=SZ9S1s)

But be warned - this is by nooo means a complete collection of all materials, and there might be some mistakes. but it might still be helpful :)

good luck with your exams!
