this is an overview of the basics in physics and electrical engineering, based on the following courses:
- PE (Physic Engines) omit anything about Unity
- GED (Grundlagen der Elektrotechnik) concatenate physic basics with PE
- KT (Kommunikationstechnik)
- SNP (Systemnahe Programmierung)
- CT1 (Compuutertechnik 1)
- CT2 (Compuutertechnik 2)

and any missing parts that are important for moving forward in the world of embedded systems, microcontrollers and electronics.

My situation: I am a computer science student with a focus on embedded systems. I have a basic understanding of programming and computer architecture, but I want to deepen my knowledge in electrical engineering and physics to better understand how hardware works and how to interface with it effectively. I kind of missed the basics in my studies so far, so I want to fill that gap.

Please help me create a structured overview of the topics covered in these courses, highlighting the key concepts and principles that are essential for someone in my situation. The goal is to create a comprehensive yet concise reference that I can use to review and reinforce my understanding of these subjects.

Structure of my repo: I have a very messy collection of the Semesters 1-4, which is why the contents are all in the subfolder *subject*/old/ in each of the subjects from 1st-4th Semester. I already created new folders in each subject for the new, cleaned up and structured content: *subject*/LateX/

What I plan on doing:
- For each subject (the ones listed above), create a clean and structured version of the current materials from the respective *subject*/old/ folders. This is NOT a summary, but a cleaned up and structured version of the existing materials, that contain all lecture materials, exercises, and additional resources. Location of the new materials: *subject*/LateX/
- See the existing materials on how I use LateX and also the style sheet and example found in the directory 'misc_files/LateX/'
- AFTER that is completed for each subject, I will create a summary of the most important concepts and principles from each subject as a sort of "master overview" that ties everything together and highlights the connections between the different subjects. This is the final goal, but first I need to clean up the individual subjects.
